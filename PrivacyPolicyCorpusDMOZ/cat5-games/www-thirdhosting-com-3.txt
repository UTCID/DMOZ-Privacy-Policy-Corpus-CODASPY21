(ii) Third Generation’s AUP and (iii) this SLA, each of which is incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof (collectively, the

Service or AUP, as applicable. Customer’s use of Third Generation’s website,
The Third Generation Network, and the Products and Services is also subject to

THE RIGHT TO AMEND, ALTER, MODIFY, REPLACE OR SUSPEND, FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS
SOLE DISCRETION, ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THIS SLA,
ITS AUP OR PRIVACY POLICY. CURRENT COPIES OF THIRD GENERATION’S TERMS OF
SERVICE, AUP AND PRIVACY POLICY MAY BE REVIEWED OR PRINTED BY CUSTOMER AT THE
LEGAL SECTION OF THIRD GENERATION’S WEBSITE. CUSTOMER HEREBY REPRESENTS AND
WARRANTS THAT IT HAS READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THE SLA AND AUP. By submitting the online order form,
Customer hereby agrees to the following:
1. Definitions
(a) “AUP” means Third Generation’s standard acceptable usage

and subject to all changes, modifications and replacements as Third Generation
may effect in accordance with the Terms of Service and AUP. (b) “Order Form” means Third Generation’s standard service
exhibit, service addendum or order form, specifying the products and services
purchase by Customer, as in effect from time to time. (c) “Products and Services” means those products and services

purchased by a Customer and set forth on an Order Form. (d) “Privacy Policy” means Third Generation’s standard privacy
policy, as in effect and listed on Third Generation’s website from time to time
and subject to all changes, modifications and replacements as Third Generation
may effect in accordance with the Terms of Service and AUP. (e) “Scheduled Maintenance” means all maintenance services for which Third Generation gives Customer at least two (2) days prior notice of
such maintenance services via Third Generation’s online client support area or
Third Generation’s maintenance mailing list. (f) “Service Credit” means a credit, calculated in accordance
with this SLA, issued by Third Generation to the Customer in respect of
products and services contracted for, but not delivered by Third Generation in
accordance with the Agreement due to a Qualified Network Downtime Event. (g) “Terms of
Service” means either (i) Third Generation’s standard terms of service as in
effect and listed on Third Generation’s website as of the date of Customer’s

and Customer have separately negotiated written terms of service different from
those referred to in clause (i), Third Generation’s standard terms of service
which incorporate such other written terms of service, duly executed and
delivered by each party; in each case, as amended from time to time. (h) “Third
Generation” means Third Generation Internet Services. (i) “Third
Generation Network” means the portion internal computer network owned or
operated on behalf of Third Generation.
2. Network Availability
Third
Generation assures Customer 100% uptime availability of the Third Generation
Network covered by this SLA. Subject to
Section 3 below, in the event that Third Generation fails to provide Customer
with the Products and Services purchased by Customer in accordance with the Agreement
and such failure results from the complete unavailability of the Third
Generation Network (other than as specified below, each such event, a
“Qualified Network Downtime Event”), Third Generation will issue Customer a
Service Credit calculated as follows.
(a) A Qualified
Network Downtime Event shall start upon Customer’s submission of a written
trouble ticket specifying that a Qualified Network Downtime Event has occurred
and the details associated with such Qualified Network Downtime Event. All such
trouble tickets must be submitted by Customer through Third Generation’s client
support area or through Third Generation’s technical support department and are
subject to confirmation by Third Generation prior to qualifying for any Service
Credit. Subject to Section 3 below, upon the passage of five (5) continuous
minutes of a Qualified Network Downtime Event, the Service Credit shall equal
five percent (5%) of the monthly fees payable by Customer in respect of such
Products and Services for the month in which such Qualified Network Downtime
Event first occurred and thereafter during the pendency of such unavailability,
the Service Credit shall increase by an additional five percent (5%) for each
continuous thirty (30) minutes of a Qualified Network Downtime Event up to a
maximum of one hundred percent (100%) of monthly fees payable by Customer in
respect of such Products and Services for the month in which such Qualified
Network Downtime Event first occurred.
(b) All Service
Credits are calculated by Third Generation on a
“per-event-basis/per-related-series-of-events-basis” and in no event will
downtime or unavailability be cumulated during any monthly period for purposes
of determining a Customer’s right to any Service Credit. The following events
do not constitute a Qualified Network Downtime Event or qualify for any Service
Credit under this SLA: (i) Scheduled
Maintenance or (ii) Customer generated outages created by failed equipment,
customer mis-configurations, exploited servers, or traffic in excess of the maximum
allowed by contract. Service Credits are based directly on all equipment and/or
services affected by a Qualified Network Downtime Event. Products, services or
hardware not related to a Qualified Network Downtime Event do not qualify for a
Service Credit. Redundant Internet connectivity is measured as traffic routing
into and out of a Customer’s equipment through the Third Generation Network out
to internet backbone carriers and does not include third party carrier latency
or peering issues not utilized by Third Generation.
3. Service Credits
Service
Credits do not constitute a refund in respect of any product or service and may
not be carried forward to future months, paid for or exchanged for cash or
other monetary consideration or value. Service Credits are not available (i) in
respect of any outage or event associated with Scheduled Maintenance or arising
from any denial of service attack, virus, hacking attempts or any other
circumstances or events that are not within the control of Third Generation,
including any Force Majeure Event, (ii) to any Customer that is more than ten (10)
days past due on any amount owing to Third Generation or any Customer that has
breached the Agreement or (iii) in respect of any products or services
contracted for with Third Generation that expressly exclude technical support
or such Service Credits. Valid approved Service Credits will appear as a credit
for products and services and be applied against the amounts owing in respect
of such products and services on the next billable invoice following the month
in which occurred the Qualified Network Downtime Event giving rise to such
Service Credit. In order for a Customer to qualify for a Service Credit, the
Customer must (A) have purchased and paid for Products and Services, (B) submit
a request for a Service Credit, as applicable, in writing via Third Generation’s
client support area within three (3) days from the date of event giving rise
the requested Service Credit and in accordance with the terms of this SLA.
Failure to request a Service Credit in accordance with the terms of this SLA
will result in an automatic waiver of any rights to such Service Credit under
this SLA in respect of the event giving rise
to such Service Credit. IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OUTAGE OR RELATED SERIES OF
OUTAGES GIVING RISE TO ANY SERVICE CREDIT HEREUNDER SPANS MORE THAN ONE
CALENDAR MONTH, THE MAXIMUM TOTAL SERVICE CREDIT TO WHICH CUSTOMER SHALL BE
ENTITLED FOR SUCH OUTAGE OR RELATED SERIES OF OUTAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE
HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) OF CUSTOMER’S MONTHLY RECURRING FEE FOR THE PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES DURING THE FIRST MONTH IN WHICH SUCH OUTAGE OR RELATED SERIES OF
OUTAGES FIRST OCCURRED AND CUSTOMER SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY OTHER SERVICE
CREDITS IN RESPECT OF SUCH OUTAGE OR RELATED SERIES OF OUTAGES FOR THE OTHER MONTHS
DURING THE PENDENCY OF SUCH OUTAGE OR RELATED SERIES OF OUTAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING IN THE AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE MAXIMUM TOTAL SERVICE CREDITS TO
WHICH CUSTOMER MAY BE ENTITLED UNDER THIS SLA
DURING ANY CALENDAR MONTH TOGETHER WITH ALL OTHER SERVICE CREDITS, REFUNDS,
GUARANTEES, WARRANTIES AND OTHER SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS CUSTOMER MAY HAVE
WITH THIRD GENERATION, SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) OF
CUSTOMER’S MONTHLY RECURRING FEE FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AFFECTED DURING
SUCH MONTH.
4. Scheduled Maintenance
Customer
hereby acknowledges that Third Generation may, from time to time, perform
maintenance service on the Third Generation Network, with or without notice to
Customer, which may result in the unavailability of the Third Generation
Network. Downtime or unavailability resulting from Scheduled Maintenance shall
not constitute a Qualified Network Downtime Event or qualify for any Service
Credit. Customer must subscribe to Third Generation’s maintenance mailing list
and provide accurate and timely information in Third Generation’s client
support area in order for Third Generation to notify Customer of all Scheduled
Maintenance. Customer’s failure to subscribe to Third Generation’s maintenance
mailing list or to provide accurate and timely information on Third Generation’s
client support area may result in the forfeiture of any Service Credit based on
downtime or unavailability arising from Scheduled Maintenance for which
Customer did not receive timely notice. Emergency maintenance and maintenance
for which Third Generation has not given Customer notice in accordance with
this SLA shall not be deemed Scheduled Maintenance for purposes of this SLA.
5. Disclaimer
Customer hereby
acknowledges that Third Generation’s ability to provide Products and Services
and technical support to Customer and to manage any server owned or controlled
by or leased to Customer is contingent upon Third Generation’s ability to
connect the Third Generation Network to such server and monitor such server. In
the event that Customer substantially impairs Third Generation’s ability to
connect to any server owned or controlled by or leased to Customer, including,
but not limited to, through the installation of software, including, but not
limited to, firewall software or load balancing software, or through the
configuration of such server, then Third Generation shall have no obligation to
provide Products and Services or technical support services or any of the
services provided for in this SLA for such server and Customer shall not be
entitled to any Service Credit under this Agreement with respect to such
server. If Customer requests technical support services or management services
for a server for which Customer has impaired the ability of Third Generation to
connect to such server, Third Generation shall provide such technical support
services or management services as professional services on a time and material
basis and Customer shall be billed at Third Generation’s then-current
professional services rate. Third Generation shall not be liable for the
failure or delay in performing its obligations hereunder or under the Agreement
if such failure or delay is due to external circumstances beyond its reasonable
control, including, without limitation, acts of any governmental body, war,
insurrection, sabotage, embargo, fire, flood, strike or other labor
disturbance, interruption of or delay in transportation, unavailability of
interruption or delay in telecommunications, failure of third party software or
inability to obtain raw materials, supplies, or power used in or equipment
needed for provision of Third Generation’s products and services (each, a
“Force Majeure Event”). Third Generation agrees to exercise reasonable efforts
to mitigate the damage arising from Force Majeure Event; however, under no
circumstances will Third Generation or its affiliates be held liable for any
cost, expense, liability, claim or damage due to such interruptions. In no
event shall Third Generation or its affiliates be liable to Customer or any
other person for any special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages of
any kind, including, without limitation, refunds of fees, loss of profits, cost
of cover, loss of income or cost of replacement services. Customer acknowledges
and agrees that the receipt of a Service Credit as provided for in this SLA
constitutes Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Third Generation’s sole
and exclusive liability, for any failure of the Third Generation Network or
failure by Third Generation to provide Customer with the products and services
purchased by Customer in accordance with the Agreement which results from a
Qualified Downtime Event. THIRD GENERATION RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AMEND, MODIFY
OR TERMINATE THIS SLA, THE AUP AND THE PRIVACY POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME, AND A
CUSTOMER’S USE OF THIRD GENERATION’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE THIRD
GENERATION NETWORK AFTER ANY SUCH AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION OF
THIS SLA, THE AUP OR THE PRIVACY POLICY IS POSTED ON THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT PAGE
OF THIRD GENERATION’S WEBSITE (WWW.THIRDHOSTING.COM) WILL CONSTITUTE THE
CUSTOMER’S ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH AMENDMENTS, MODIFICATIONS OR TERMINATION.
