Cookies, Privacy Policy, and Advertising
A particularly silly EU directive requires me to state if cookies are used on my web sites and what they do to invade visitor privacy etc. This is on a par with asking the Borgias if the food at their banquet contains nuts, since there are far more dangerous and intrusive technologies out there, but never mind...
To the best of my knowledge neither of the web sites I currently maintain use any cookies at all; I'm not actually competent to program them, and there would be no point since you don't have to log in etc. anyway.
I can't make this statement for the web hosting company I use, Nativespace, they may be using cookies for some reason but I haven't asked them to.
Registered users may be given passwords for temporary access to file downloads - their use probably involves cookies, but this is handled entirely by Nativespace, the hosting company, and I do not give them information on the identity of users with password access.
Some links on this site connect to other sites that may use cookies; most notably, if you register as a Forgotten Futures user you may choose to pay via PayPal, in which case I will be sent your contact details as part of the payment procedure - I do not pass details of registered users to any other person, company, or site.
The news feed on this site is an InsaneJournal blog; like most blogs they use cookies for user registration etc.; I do not provide any data to Insanejournal, or receive any from them.
As always a reminder that I am no longer able to make changes to my old NTLWorld web site, and really don't know what goes on under the hood there, including cookies - PLEASE don't use it.
Finally, I'm repeatedly asked to carry advertising, presumably to make money by tracking hits. I will NEVER do this, or carry any form of paid link; I really don't need a few pence badly enough to want to invade anyone's privacy.
