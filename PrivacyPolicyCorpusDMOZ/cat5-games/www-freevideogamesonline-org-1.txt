Privacy and Cookies Policy
Our websites are unfortunately now fully GDPR compliant. We know this is a pain for everyone and regret that we now have to ask EU users to click yet another button.
The Free Video Games Project and its related websites below have a straightforward privacy and cookies policy. We do not not collect, track or store personal information at all. Some of our websites use a cookie that counts how many times your computer has visited, but we have no idea who you actually are.
Like most websites we use well-known 3rd party services to analyze web statistics, and provide ad optimization. These services use cookies. We use Google and Freestar for our advertising and you can click each link provided to opt out of their cookies or learn more.
Other 3rd party services we use are Google Analytics and Quantcast and they have their own privacy policies, also linked. You can globally manage your cookies if this troubles you, and choose not to receive them through a variety of methods. A good starting point for research is the Wikipedia entry for cookies.
If you wish to know more about advertising practices or would like to know more about your options, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") web-site. The NAI is a cooperative of online advertising companies who are committed to responsible practices and consumer protection.
