That said, we feel that your rights to privacy should always come first. In the spirit of transparency, this Privacy Policy outlines what information Concrete Software and its third party partners collect, how it is used, and your rights with regard to your own information.

We may also send an email or provide notice within some or all of our Services when this Privacy Policy changes. Each time a user accesses our Services, the Platform or 3rd Party Platform Games, the then current version of the Privacy Policy applies, and you agree that the information we collect will be subject to the Privacy Policy, as updated.

How We Collect Information and How We Use it
Cookies: Some of our Web pages utilize “cookies” and other widely-used tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Website activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Website.

With Whom We Share Your Information
If you choose to provide us with your Information, we may transfer that Information within Concrete Software or Concrete Software’s third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country of jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
Concrete Software strives to comply with all applicable laws around the world (including GDPR) that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Concrete Software intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an “adequate” level of protection for your Personal Information. In general, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is obtained, transferred, or retained.
We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity. When third party technologies or social tools are integrated into our products, those third parties may collect information when you use our products. An example is the Facebook “Like” button.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
We are committed to privacy. Protecting your privacy is an evolving area, and Concrete Software’s games and sites are constantly evolving to meet these demands. Wherever your Information may be held within Concrete Software or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure. While we strive to take all appropriate measures to protect your information, we are not able to 100% guarantee the security of your information and we do not assume responsibility for the unauthorized use, access, or disclosure of your information.
Children
Protecting children’s privacy is extremely important to Concrete Software. Our games and services are intended for general audiences and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the required age, please contact us via email here:  support@concretesoftware.com
Your Choice
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Concrete Software. As a user of our software, you have the right to receive the data we collect and you may request that we delete that data at any time. If you decide to play the game after your personal information has been deleted, you may lose your save data. If you choose to start playing the game again , we collect new data from you as a user.
If you choose to have a relationship with Concrete Software, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
The Right to Request Deletion
You have the right to request that your personal information be deleted.  You also have the right to inform us that you do not wish us to sell personal information collected to third parties.  In order to make those requests, please contact us via email here:  support@concretesoftware.com or opt-out on a third party provider’s website.
