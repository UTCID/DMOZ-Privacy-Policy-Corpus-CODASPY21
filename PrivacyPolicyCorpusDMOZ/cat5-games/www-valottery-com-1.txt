Your Rights
Subject to applicable terms and conditions, we may allow you to use the Portal for a reasonable period of time (as determined by us in our discretion) following your termination as a Retailer.

In such circumstances, you may be asked to accept the terms and policies of such provider.

For third-party products and services available to you through this Portal, we may share any or all of the information we collect with such provider to assist in your receipt of and access to such products and services. In such circumstances, you may be asked to accept the terms and policies of such provider.
