Despite the enhanced edition of Baldur's Gate being taken down from digital stores last week due to legal issues, developer Beamdog said that its long-term goal of making Baldur's Gate III was still possible.
Baldur's Gate fans may not want to hold their breath for a third game.
According to company president Trent Oster (in an interview with website Rock Paper Shotgun), the chances of the company resuming work on the original Baldur's Gate franchise was mixed. "Best case, we can sort this out soon. Worst case, this could be in legal hell for a while. I like making games, but this contractual dispute [issue] keeps me up at night," he said.
Despite this, Beamdog has yet to give up on making Baldur's Gate III happen. "Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition is on indefinite hold, as is the current patch. Baldur's Gate III, we are still interested in the concept, but currently I'd say we were very demoralized." The developer declined to name name the publisher that is pursuing the trademark.
