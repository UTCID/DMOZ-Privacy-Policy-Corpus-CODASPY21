Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to iWin. IWin operates various websites with game-related products and services (our "Sites") and provides applications for the
provision of various online and mobile services, such as search and gaming (collectively, "Applications") through which personal information may be
collected. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to all personal information collected by iWin through our Sites and Applications.
If iWin is operating the Sites or Applications under an agreement with a specific partner, the branding of the Site or the Application will indicate the
specific partner with which iWin operates the Site or Application ("Identified Partners"). In such an event, iWin may share the data collected with that
particular identified Partner. Accordingly, iWin's use of your data is subject to our Privacy Policy - and our Identified Partner's use of your data is
subject to its privacy policy. You should familiarize yourself with such Identified Partner's privacy policy. Some of iWin's Identified Partners serve
their own ads or use other ad-serving networks. To opt out of data collection by an Identified Partner's ad-serving network, please see that Identified
Partner's privacy policy.
This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the information collected online through Sites and Applications maintained by iWin, and not to
websites or services offered and operated by other companies or organizations to which we link. Additionally, this Privacy Policy does not cover
information that we collect through other methods, such as mail-in sweepstakes.
IWin is headquartered in the United States and the collected data is stored in the United States. Although we operate Sites and maintain some operations
outside the United States, when you become a member of one of our online communities or programs, make a purchase from iWin or register for one of the
Applications, your account is with a United States company and your data will be stored in the United States. By registering and using this Site, Members
acknowledge that the processing of their personally identifying information for the purposes described above may involve the transfer of such personally
identifying information from within the European Economic Area ("EEA") to countries outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not be as
stringent as that within the European Union.
In accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this Privacy Policy contains information about the personal and usage data iWin
collects about each user, and how that information is collected, stored and managed.
To request your personal and product usage data, please email support@iwin.com.
BY USING THIS SITE, APPLICATION, OR USING ANY OF THE RELATED SERVICES, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO IWIN'S PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IWIN MAY
PROCESS YOUR DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE OR APPLICATION OR IF ALREADY A
MEMBER YOU MUST TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
If you are a visitor to a Site or a user of an Application, you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly provide us
with on an individual basis ("Personal Information") and statistical and usage information collected using cookies and other technologies as you browse the
Site or use an Application ("Usage Information").
1. Personal Information
Registration Information
You will need to provide us information about yourself, your firm or company, and your preferences when you register on one of the Sites or for one of the
Applications. The specific information collected will vary depending on the Site or Application, includes your email address and/or username (or player
name), . Registration is not required to browse any of our Sites, but you will not be able to view certain content or use aspects of certain Sites or
Applications that require registration if you do not provide the requested information.
Credit Card Information
If you choose to purchase products or services from us or our partners, you will need to provide a valid credit card number, postal code, expiration date,
and Security Code (CVV), in addition to email address and billing address iWin securely transmits Credit Card Information to our payment processor for
verification and processing, and never stores your full credit card number, expiration date or Security Code For subscription purchases, iWin stores the
last 4 digits of your credit card number, used for account, billing and purchase verification, and displays this in your secure Account page on the iWin
website and in the iWin Games Manager application For all transactions, iWin employs secure servers and the secure server software (SSL) to encrypt all
payment information. In all instances, iWin has made a substantial investment in server, database, backup, and firewall technologies to protect the assets
of the Site, including the confidentiality of information collected about Members. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security
architecture and protocol.
Email Information
In addition to providing us with your email address as part of registration, if you choose to correspond with us via email or by using a web interface to
reach customer support, we may retain the content of your messages together with your email address and our responses.
2. Usage Information
Similar to other commercial websites, we utilize standard technologies such as "cookies," clear GIFs (also known as "web beacons" or "action tags") and web
server logs to collect information about how the Sites and Applications are used. Additionally, when you connect to or download an Application, we may
retrieve information from the computer used to log onto the Application. The information we collect may include technical information about your computer,
system and application software, and peripherals, and any data related to the use and operation of the software used in connection with the
Application.
Cookies
As an important and necessary part of providing customizable and personalized services to our Members, iWin sites or its advertisers may use cookies, web
beacons, and similar technologies to store and sometimes track non-personal information about Members while on the Website. A cookie is a small amount of
data that is sent to a Member's browser from a Web server and stored on a Member's computer hard drive. Areas of iWin sites where Members are prompted to
log in or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies. These technologies are also used to help iWin track the response to messages sent to Members
on the part of marketers so that iWin can monitor and report campaign results to the marketer and track response history and campaign effectiveness. In
addition, banner advertisements are displayed on our websites which may contain certain cookies. While iWin uses cookies in other parts of our websites,
the cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertising partners, and iWin does not have access to this information. Members may opt out of
the advertising that they see on our sites targeted specifically to them by going to the respective sites' privacy policy(ies) and following directions. To
opt out of Google's "interest-based ads" and to learn more about Google's collection of personal information to serve ads in connection with iWin, please
go to www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/. With respect to cookies, users have a choice. By modifying their browser preferences, they have the choice to
accept all cookies; they will be unable to use those iWin services that require the use of cookies in order to participate.
Clear GIFs
Clear GIFs are small, invisible graphic images (usually only one pixel) placed on a web page or email message to capture statistical usage information. They
are not used to collect personal information about you.
IP Addresses
An IP address is a number assigned to your computer every time you are connected to the internet. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server
as part of demographic and profile data known as "traffic data" so that appropriate data (such as the web pages you request) and geographically relevant
content can be sent to you.
HARDWARE ID
iWin stores the hardware id, a unique identifier associated with the PC computer you use to access our websites and Applications, to determine a unique user
within our systems. The hardware ID allows iWin to determine if multiple accounts have been created on the same PC, and to prevent attempts by a single
user or household to receive introductory offers to our subscription program(s) multiple times by using different email addresses or credit cards during
registration and checkout. multiple accounts or using multiple credit cards.
The hardware ID may also be associated with any activity the user has taken in the context of a marketing campaign, such as viewed a promotional page,
installed the Download Games Manager Application, initiated a game download, created an account or created a subscription, or canceled the a
subscription.
CUSTOMER ID
When a user creates an account on the iWin system, that user is assigned a Customer ID, which is displayed in the Personal Information section of My
Account. The Customer ID gives the user a fixed non changing identifier that stays with their account from point of creation.
When a user registers on the iWin system, a single sign on account is created, and a unique user identity (uuid) is generated at this point in time and
saved in the user’s database record. This uuid does not change over time, unlike other personal data such as email address, postal code and credit card
information. The Customer Id is thus connected to an end user’s account, and by extension can be used to find the user’s current:
Email address.
Hardware ID
All other data related to the end user in the iWin system.
If a user has multiple accounts within a single website or multiple websites operated by iWin, each account has a unique Customer ID.
ADVERTISING
Our Advertisers
IWin's advertisers and advertising vendors display targeted advertisements. Although we do not provide any personal information to the advertiser or
advertising vendor, by interacting with or clicking on an ad you acknowledge the possibility that the advertiser may assume you meet the targeting criteria
used.
In addition to cookies placed by iWin or its agents as described above, advertisers and advertising vendors that serve ads onto our Sites may use their own
cookies or other tracking technologies. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
Uses of your Personal Information
IWin will use your information primarily to provide you with our products and services and to receive payment from you. In order to do this, we may
determine whether you meet the minimum system requirements to use our products. We may also ask you to participate in surveys about products, services,
news, and events; we may offer you product upgrades and games for you to purchase or access through a paid subscription service. You may opt out of some of
these uses.
IWin may also provide Personal Information to companies we engage as contractors or agents to perform services for us, such as maintaining software,
providing email marketing, or administering a sweepstakes or contest. Information will be shared with contractors only to the extent reasonably necessary
for them to perform these services on our behalf, and pursuant to confidentiality obligations. Members should note that iWin may change this Policy at any
time, and therefore iWin may in the future store some information for additional purposes not currently included in this policy.

terms of the applicable Site or Application, to improve our products or services or to provide Services or technologies to you.
iWin uses third-party tracking services to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and advertisements to prospective customers and customers who have
used our services. These services do not obtain or store any personally identifying information, but do record user activity at an anonymous level, such as
pages viewed, buttons clicked, Games Manager application and game installs, account registrations and subscriptions created. Third party services may
assign a unique user identification number for these events, but this will not be associated with any personal information provided to iWin by the
user.

The safety of children is important to us. IWin's websites are for a general audience that is not directed to children under the age of 18. Similarly,
iWin's services are not directed to or intended for anyone under the age of 18. IWin will not knowingly accept members who are under the age of 18 years
nor will it knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from or about anyone under the age of 18 years. IWin relies on the
truthfulness of the registration when accepting new Members. In the event that iWin receives information that establishes that a Member is under the age of
18 years, iWin reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate that Member's membership or take other steps that it determines are appropriate in
the circumstances, such as providing parental notification. IWin may also delete all information in our databases about that terminated Member.

Our corporate values, ethical standards, and practices are committed to the appropriate protection of customer and visitor information. In general, our
business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons,
processes, and transactions. This obligation continues once an employee has left our company.

content contained in any search results or third-party websites. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics
that may be of interest to the users of our Sites and Applications. Please remember that when you use a link to go from a Site to another website, our
Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on one of our Sites, is
subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
