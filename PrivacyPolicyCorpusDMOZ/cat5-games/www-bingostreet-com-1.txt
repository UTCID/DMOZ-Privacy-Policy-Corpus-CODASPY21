WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
We collect two types of information from our Users:
Personal Information
The first type of information that we collect is information that identifies or may reasonably identify an individual reasonable effort (“Personal Information”). Personal Information that is being gathered may consist of the following:
Account details: When you open an account and register to use the Services, you will be asked to provide us certain details about yourself, such as: first and last name, email address, gender, birth date, personal numeric code, age, physical address, ID number, fiscal code, phone number and occupation. In addition, we may collect certain information as required under various gambling regulations, as well as Know Your Client (“KYC”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) regulatory requirements, such as your source of funds.

functions of the Services (e.g. place bets, perform purchases, play in
tournaments, etc.), payment information will be collected from you, such as
your currency, credit card number and bank account details.
Voluntary information: We also collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, when you respond to communications from us, communicate with us via email or share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services, such as on the chat feature and in games. This includes information you are willing to share with us for the purpose of improving and developing our relationship with you, as well as for maintaining your stratification from our services (for example, information about your marital status and family, your hobbies and interests, and other information you share with us through surveys).
Device information: We collect specific types of
connection details and information with regard to your device, software or
hardware that may identify you, such as: device’s unique identifiers (e.g.

data.
Telephone calls: We record or monitor telephone calls
for customer support, training and/or security purposes.
Events: during our events, we conduct interview and take photos and videos, which may feature attendees, speakers, sponsors or exhibitors.
Where photos and videos are taken that feature you as an attendee, speaker, sponsor or exhibitor, we may use those photos and videos for promotional purposes. We may also use your interview for promotional purposes (such as by quoting you).
Social networks: When you register through your social
network account (such as your Facebook account), to use the Services or connect
your player account with such account, we will have access to basic information
from your social network account, such as your name, birthdate, profile picture
and friends’ list, as well as information you made publicly available on such
account.
In addition, when using the Services, you may be able via
your social network to "Invite a Friend" to use the Services. Should
the person accept your invitation, we may obtain Personal Information from

use the Personal Information for the purposes set out herein and disclose such
information only to third parties as detailed in this Privacy Policy.

Information from third party service providers, such as information about your
credit history from credit agencies and other financial information which is
relevant to the provision of the Services, as well as information which is
gathered in order to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent or illegal
activity.
Non-personal information
The second type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a User(s), which may be made available or gathered via the User’s use of the Services (“Non-Personal Information”).
Non-Personal Information which is being collected consists of technical information and aggregated usage information, and may contain, among other things, the User’s operating system, type of browser, screen resolution, browser and keyboard language, the User’s ‘click-stream’ and activities on the Services, the period of time the User visited the Services and related time stamps, etc.
For avoidance of doubt, any Non-personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.
Types of Non-personal Information we collect from or about you:
Log-in history and technical information: In order to enhance the
functionality of the Services and to provide you with a better user experience,
we collect technical information transmitted by your device, including certain
software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating
system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name
of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.).

including, amongst other things, your deposits, bets, bonuses, game session
duration and your high scores. We may also share and publish such information
through any of our Platforms.
Device and connection information: If you download the
Software to your device, we may collect information from the particular device
you are using, for security and fraud detection and prevention purposes. For
example, we may gather information with regard to other software which is
running simultaneously with the Software for detecting if you are using
software which is associated with fraudulent activity (e.g. robots, malware,
etc.) or checking if the connection you are using is via a VPN or proxy.

of the Services, such as applications’ usage, log files, user activity (e.g.
pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, online browsing,

for amongst other things troubleshooting errors and bugs as well as for
research and analytics purposes about your use of the Services.
Anonymous information: We may anonymize or de-identify the
information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information
cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such
aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions
under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation
