California Privacy Notice
California Privacy Notice
Last Updated : Janaury 18, 2020.
This California Privacy Notice (“CA Notice”) supplements the Privacy Policy of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, a federally recognized Indian tribe, doing business as Seminole Gaming (“Seminole Gaming,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and applies solely to individual residents of the state of California (“you” or “consumers”).  This CA Notice provides information concerning how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process Personal Information of California residents within the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
For purposes of this CA Notice, “Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device.
Personal Information does not include: de-identified or aggregated consumer information; health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) or the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act; or information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the California Financial Information Privacy Act.
All other capitalized terms used in this notice have the same meanings as in the Privacy Policy.
If you are a California resident who has provided Personal Information to Seminole Gaming or a California resident who believes Seminole Gaming collected your Personal Information, you may exercise your rights under the CCPA as explained in this CA Notice.
PLEASE NOTE: We have not sold and do not sell your Personal Information to any third party.
You have the following rights under the CCPA:
Right to know
Subject to certain limits, you may ask us to provide them with the following information for the 12-month period preceding your request:
The categories of Personal Information we collected about them;
The categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting Personal Information;
The categories of third parties with whom we shared the Personal Information;
The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about them (also called a data portability request);
If we disclosed Personal Information for a business purpose, a list of the disclosures for a business purpose and the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient received; and
If we sold Personal Information for a business purpose, a list of the sales and the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased (as noted above, we do not sell Personal Information).
You may only make two requests for information in a 12-month period.
Right to Request Deletion
You may also ask us to delete any Personal Information that we have collected from you.  Under the CCPA, we are not required to delete Personal Information that is necessary to: provide our Services; detect security incidents; protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; debug to identify and repair errors that impair our Sites, App, and/or Services; enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us; comply with a legal obligation; or use your Personal Information internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Right to Nondiscrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA, including by:
Denying you goods or services;
Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, the CCPA permits us to offer you certain financial incentives that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels, which are related to your Personal Information’s value. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.  We currently provide the following financial incentives:
Our loyalty program, Seminole Wild Card, allows members to earn free play rewards, “comp dollars” that can be used at our casinos, discounts on certain purchases at our properties, access to exclusive promotions and events, and personalized hotel rates.  For more information, please visit www.seminolewildcard.com.
Right to Opt Out of Sale
You have the right to direct businesses to not sell your Personal Information.  As noted above, we do not sell your Personal Information, so there is no need to opt out with us.
Submission of Requests to Know and/or Requests to Delete
You may submit a request to know or a request to delete: (a) by submitting this online form; or (b) by calling the following toll free number 1-833-970-1535.
We are required to verify your identity before responding to a request to know or a request to delete.  If you have an account with us that is password-protected, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account.  To verify your identity, we may request two or more data points of Personal Information and other proof of identification depending on the nature of the request and the Personal Information requested.
Please note that following your verified request, we will send you your Personal Information from the following email address: dataprotection@shrss.com Any response to your request including any Personal Information may be sent as an encrypted file.
Generally, we will process and respond to your request within 45 days.  As permitted by the CCPA, if we need more time to respond, we will tell you why and our time to respond will be extended by an additional 45 days (up to 90 days total).
Once you have submitted a request, we will send you a receipt acknowledging your request within 10 days.  Please be sure to check your email spam folder or filter for this receipt.  If you do not receive such a receipt within 10 days of your submitted request, please send us an email to dataprotection@shrss.com because an error may have occurred.
You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.  We may require proof that you have designated the authorized agent to act on your behalf and to verify your identity directly with us.  Please contact us at dataprotection@shrss.com for more information if you wish to submit a request through an authorized agent.
