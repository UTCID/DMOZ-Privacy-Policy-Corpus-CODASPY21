IP and other technical information
When a visitor requests or reads a page, or sends email to a Lotro-Wiki.com server, no more information is collected than is typically collected by web sites. Raw logs of such transactions are only used to monitor the health of the web server.
When a page is edited by a logged-in editor, the server confidentially stores related IP information for a limited period of time. This information is automatically deleted after a week.
Cookies
The site sets a temporary session cookie on a visitor's computer whenever a page is visited. Readers who do not intend to log in or edit may deny this cookie; it will be deleted at the end of the browser's session. More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in status. If one saves a user name or password in one's browser, that information will be saved for up to 30 days or 180 days if selecting the keep me logged in option, and this information will be resent to the server on every visit. Contributors using a public machine who do not wish to show their username to future users of the machine should clear these cookies after use.
Advertisement Cookies
(The following applies only when using the default Vector skin.)
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to any website to serve ads on this website.
Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to this website on other websites.
Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the ads preference manager and aboutads.info site.
To avoid these third-party cookies on this site select the MonoBook skin within the appearance tab for your account preferences. Other options like disabling third-party cookies within your browser settings, enabling ad-blockers or private-mode browsing might also be suitable, but advertisers are a crafty bunch (i.e. geotagging).

Page history
Edits or other contributions to articles, user pages and talk pages are generally retained forever. Removing text from a project does not permanently delete it. Normally, in projects, anyone can look at a previous version of an article and see what was there. Even if an article is "deleted", a user entrusted with higher level of access may still see what was removed from public view. Information can be permanently deleted by individuals with access to Lotro-Wiki.com on request. We generally try to permanently delete spam.
User contribution
User contributions are also aggregated and publicly available. User contributions are aggregated according to their registration and login status. Data on user contributions, such as the times at which users edited and the number of edits they have made, are publicly available via user contributions lists, and in aggregated forms published by other users.
Deletion of Account
If requested, accounts can be removed by lotroadmin, but your edits including signatures, comments and edit history will be retained.
An account with no edits or file uploads will periodically be removed after two years of inactivity.
