10. Usage of Integrated Games/Additional Features
Some of our upjers-games are embedded in social networks (for example Facebook). The games will be called there, for example, ìappsî or ìapplicationsî. Furthermore some games might provide additional features, which allow in connection with a certain network the interaction between players (e.g. Twitch extensions). For its data processing and possible data transmission in accordance with data protection, the respective network itself is responsible and enlightens the user in its own data protection declaration. (compare Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php; Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/privacy-notice/).
We would like to point out, however, that you might be asked by the network to agree to the transmission of personal data if you want to use an integrated upjers game or additional features in the scope of a network. In the case of Facebook, the following data can be affected:
first name, surname, sex, birth date
profile picture or corresponding URL
log-in email address, which has been used at the registration of Facebook
location and access devices
user-ID- number, which is linked to public accessible information (on Facebook)
user-ID- number to your friends, which are likewise connected with the game
As long as you agree to the data transmission, the network might send in some circumstances data to upjers. upjers will only process such data if it is absolutely necessary for providing you with the game or certain additional features. upjers points out that you can influence the extent of information yourself, which the network is transferring, through the corresponding privacy settings. Exertion of influence could especially be exercised
through
controlling, which information your Facebook friends share with you/ about you,
blocking certain applications, and/ or preventing them from raising certain information about you,
ignoring certain invitations to games,
controlling, who can see all your activities.
11. Social Sign-In & Social Log In
Besides the manual registration, we also offer you the possibility to directly register yourself at upjers with your already existing user account from another platform (e.g. Facebook, Amazon). If you would like to use this form of registration, you will be forwarded to the website of the provider in question after the selection of the platform and navigated through the registration process there.
As a measure of protection, transmission of the data entered by you will take place via an encrypted connection to the platform in question. We do not use the registration to access personal data like friend lists, or contacts, or for saving them for our own purposes. A
temporary connection between your user account and the user account of Facebook and Amazon does not take place.
Both networks are subjected to the EU Standardized Contractual Terms and Conditions and by doing so a possible data transfer to the USA is legitimated (for further information please consult the the respective data protection declarations). Which data is raised by networks in the scope of the registration or how the data is connected, is not known to us. Further details can be found in the data protection declaration of Facebook (https://de-de.facebook.com/policy.php) and Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496).
Purpose of the data asked is the registration via an already existing user account for the use of
extended functions on the website. The registration via social networks is voluntarily and can always be recalled and/ or the user account can be deregistered.
Legal Basis is your agreement in accordance with the European Data Protection Requirements from Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR, which you can give in the scope of our cookie banners.
12. Communication in the Games
The games run by us offer you the possibility to communicate with us or with other players. We use automatic filter systems, which prevent the plentiful sending of messages, insulting, violence-glorifying, obscene, racist or whatever offensive statements, or news with promotional character. Further, we record: for the purposes of analyses and rectification of technical errors; for the warranty of system security and system integrity; for combatting abusive and/ or unauthorised usage, as well as for the preparation of user statistics on non-personal related basis, and the use of the provided communication channels for a short time. The reports created contain date and time of the news, sender and recipient, the text message, as well as the transmitted amount of data.
Without your agreement, none of our staff-members will read messages. If we have suspicion of abusive and/ or unauthorised usage of the communication channels provided (for example by a report of the recipient), we nevertheless reserve ourself the right to examine the player account in question, as well as the player account from which the message was sent and ñ if need be ñ take further measures.
As a measure of protection, the transmission of the data entered by you will take place via an encrypted connection to the platform in question.
Purpose of the processing is the provision of an ingame solution for communication for the exchange of messages between the players.
Legal basis for the temporary storage of data is Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR as well as Article 6 Paragraph 1 f GDPR. The input of data for the purpose of communication is voluntarily, and therefore on the basis of agreement by the user. The use of filter systems serves the purpose of keeping the conditions and protecting the data of third parties. In this purposes lies our rightful interest in data procession according to Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR. The input of data for the purpose of communication is based on your consent in accordance with Article 6 Article 1 lit. a GDPR, which you can give by sending a message. The use of filter systems serves the purpose of keeping the conditions and protecting the data of third parties. In these purposes also lies our rightful interest in data procession according to Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR. The interest to protect our customers from possible criminal offenses, like e.g. insults, eventually outweighs the interest in a completely anonymous communication.
13. Payment Handling
If you initiate a payment process to purchase premium currency, you will have to provide further data. The nature of the required data depends on the chosen payment method. Furthermore, upjers allows you to use anonymous payment methods.
You will have a variety of payment providers to choose from. In addition, the cooperation with third parties involves the payment processing via external payment providers (PayPal, credit card companies, mobile network operators, Paysafecard, cash payment, immediate transfer, etc.). All external payment providers are by law obliged to the secure handling of your data, and they are solely allowed to use your data as far as it is necessary for the fulfilment of their task.
You are able to choose freely which payment method you want to use, and therefore we would like to refer to the privacy policies and regulations of the respective payment provider.
The payment provider will collect personal data of the customer on their own responsibility to execute the payment. Thereafter, a response of the payment provider is sent to upjers, in which the successful completion of the payment process is confirmed. Normally, we don't receive person-related transaction data from the payment providers.
However, we point out that we will save the IP address of the customer when a payment process is confirmed. The sole objective is the fulfilment of our tax obligations. The IP address is used to determine the location of performance for tax objectives. The data is stored according to the fiscal period of time for safeguarding.
As an exception further person-related data will already be collected on our websites in case of the utilization of the following payment methods:
ìPurchase by Monthly Invoicingî
In the scope of the payment processing upjers collects person-related data via a form and forwards this to the payment provider Payolution GmbH and the commissioned banking house for the solvency check. Further information regarding the data processing will be provided for you in a special data protection declaration in the scope of the payment process. The processing of your person-related data will only be executed with your consent, which you can give during the payment process.
14. Emails/Newsletter
We will send emails that directly affect the contractual relationship, e. g. contract confirmation, to the email address stated during the registration process.
We will not send you emails that not directly affect the contractual relationship, e. g. newsletter, without your prior consent.
We use the so-called Double-Opt-In Procedure to ask you for giving us permission to provide you with our newsletter. We will only send you a newsletter via email if you confirm that you would like to receive our newsletter by clicking on the link within the notification email.
Of course you can unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time. Therefore, you will find a respective link in every newsletter. Alternatively, you can contact our support staff via the support form or via email: support@upjers.com.

function and performance-related cookies (these help us, for instance, to evaluate technical data of your visit on our website to prevent error messages). Such cookies serve the goal to enhance our offer with additional features, which exceed the technically necessary level and highly increase the user experience. Furthermore this also includes simple tracking pixels, which anonymously and statistically register certain actions on the sites and especially serve to measure and calculate the advertising campaigns. We do not use function- and performance-related cookies for collecting person-related data or for advertising purposes.

Legal Basis for the implementation of technically required cookies is the execution of the contractual relationship. The legal basis for the implementation of function- and performance-related cookies is our rightful interest. Under consideration of the low interference intensity the interest in the provision of user-friendly services and the winning of new customers prevails and this allows the utilization of function- and performance-related cookies. The legal basis for the implementation cookies that serve for the analysis of user behavior or the displaying of advertisements is your consent, which you can give in the scope of our cookie banners or in other ways (e.g. 2-click solutions) when visiting our homepage.
16. Youtube
We use YouTube for directly embedding videos. YouTube is operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. When playing the embedded videos,
a connection to the Google servers is established and at least your IP address is transmitted for technical reasons. In addition, if you are logged into your account, Google will assign, e.g. information to your personal user account about the videos watched. You can prevent this procedure by logging out from your Google account, before you use our website.
The high security standards of the google platform and the associated privacy policy of google are regarded as protective measures (https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB). As Google is based in the USA, a so-called non-member State, further warranties are essential to ensure an adequate European level of data protection. Google is subjected to the EU Standardized Contractual Terms and Conditions and by doing so a possible data transfer to the USA is legitimated.
Furthermore, we embed YouTube videos with advanced privacy settings and a server solution. The user is initially solely shown a preview image, which is loaded from an upjers server. Only after pressing the Play-button is the YouTube frame activated and a limited data exchange with YouTube proceeds.
The purpose of data transmission is to integrate YouTube's video service, which is acclaimed among our users, for them to conveniently access the videos displayed without leaving our website.
The legal basis is your consent in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR, which you can give by activating the YouTube player.

18. Goolge Analytics
We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses the aforementioned cookies for advertising and analysing purposes, to analyse our website regarding your user behaviour. The information generated by cookies about the use of this website is transferred to and stored in a Google server based in the USA. However, your IP address is shortened before the usage statistics are evaluated. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about your person. For this purpose, we extended Google Analytics on our website by the code ìanonymizelpî to ensure the anonymous collection of IP addresses. Google will use the anonymous information collected by cookies to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for website operators, and to provide other services relating to the website and internet use. In addition, Google may transfer this information to third parties if this is required by law, or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google.
However, you can also configure your browser to refuse cookies, or you can prevent Google from collecting and analysing the data by downloading and installing a browser plug-in from Google (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB). As an alternative to the browser extension or
within browsers on mobile devices, you can set an Opt-Out-Cookie to prevent future collection by Google Analytics on this website (the opt-out only works in the browser and only for this domain). If you delete your cookies in this browser, you have to click this link again.
As protective measures we use the anonymisation procedure provided by Google, whereby a subsequent evaluation proceeds on a statistical basis only, but not on the basis of your person. In addition, the high security standards of the Google platform and the associated privacy policy of Google apply (https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB). Moreover, we have concluded a specific data protection agreement with Google, which stipulates the protection of your data via technical and organisational security measures. As Google is based in the USA and thus in a so-called non-Member State, further warranties are essential to ensure an adequate European level of data protection. Google has been certified under the so-called EU-US Privacy Shield and has thus demonstrated an appropriate level of data protection (https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?gl=de&hl=en-GB).
The objective of using Google Analytics is the anonymous analysis of your user behaviour on our websites. The information acquired from this procedure helps us to improve our service.
The legal basis is the so-called legitimate interest, which has been examined in order to pursue the objective and within the framework of the aforementioned protective measures, as well as in accordance with the European data protection requirements of article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f
GDPR. Moreover, an order data processing contract was concluded, according to the specifications of article 28, GDPR.

23. Social Plug-Ins
We use the following social plug-ins on our websites: Facebook's ìLikeî button, the ìGoogle +1-button by Google and the ìTweetî-button by Twitter.
The respective service provider can be identified by the marking on the box above its initial letters as well as by the logo. We provide the option to directly communicate with the service provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the highlighted area and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online service. According to the provider in Germany,
the IP address is anonymised immediately after collection in the case of Facebook. By activating the plug-in, personal data is transferred from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there. Since the plug-in provider obtains data especially via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies using the security settings of your browser before clicking on the grayed-out box.
We have neither influence on the data collected and data processing procedures, nor are we aware of the full scope of data acquisition, the objectives of processing the data and the storage periods. Furthermore, we have no information on the deletion of the data obtained by the plug-in provider.
The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for means of advertising, market research and needs-oriented design of his website. Such an evaluation particularly takes place (for not logged-in users as well) for displaying needs-oriented advertisements, and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you have to contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right. We provide the option to interact with social networks and other users via the plug-ins. Therefore, we are able to improve our services and make them more interesting for you as a user. The legal framework for using these plug-ins is Article 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR.
The data is transferred regardless of whether you have an account on the plug-in provider's website and are logged in there. If you are logged in on the plug-in provider's website, your data collected on our website will be directly assigned to your existing account on the plug-in provider's website. If you click on the activated button and link the page, for example, the plug-in provider stores this information in your user account, as well and notifies your contacts publicly of it. We recommend that you log out regularly from a social network after using it, especially before activating the buttons to prevent the assignment of information to your user profile on the plug-in provider's website.
Further information about the objectives and extent of this data acquisition, as well as their processing by the plug-in provider are available in the privacy policies of the providers listed below.

The platform might collect person-related data as well as website- and utilization data via fan pages. The platform might supply the providers with anonymized statistical data about the visitors of the fan pages.
According to legal practice there is a common responsibility of the platform and the fan page provider especially regarding the data processing in the scope of the fan pages on the platform Facebook. This relation is stipulated in a special agreement (www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum).
The Purpose of the data processing via the platforms are market research and advertisement proposes. This way user profiles can be created by regarding user behavior and usersí interests resulting from that. The utilization profiles can be used to operate advertisements, which could be of interest for the users, within and outside the platforms. For these purposes cookies, e.g. from Facebook, wherein the user behavior and the usersí interests will be stored, will be regularly saved on the usersí computers.
The platforms will not forward person-related data to the providers of the fan pages. If upjers receives anonymous statistics from a platform, we will exclusively use these statistics to make our fan pages even more customer-friendly.
The Legal Basis of the data processing in the scope of the fan pages is generally your consent in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a. GDPR, which you declare by registering with the individual platform. The consent can be revoked against the platform, e. g. for Facebook via https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads and http://www.youronlinechoices.com. Alternatively the utilization of such sites can be stopped.
Your Rights, especially information requests, can be most efficiently asserted against the individual platform. For this purpose Facebook provides an information portal, which allows the viewing and downloading of data collected by Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992?helpref=hc_global_nav. Only the platform can access the usersí data and directly take corresponding measures and give information. If you still need help, do not hesitate to contact us.

Sometimes it might be necessary for us to process personal data and, if required, sensitive personal data, in accordance with local laws and regulations, relating to the exercise or defence of legal claims. Article 9(2)(f)
GDPR facilitates it, if the data processing ìis essential for asserting, exercising and defending legal claims or if courts act in the course of their judicial activityî. For instance, this may be the case if we need legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are legally obliged to preserve or disclose certain information in the course of legal proceedings.
This can, for example, happen if we need legal advice in reference to a legal procedure or if we are legally obliged to keep or reveal certain information within the context of a lawsuit.
