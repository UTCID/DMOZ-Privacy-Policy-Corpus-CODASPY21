"I implore you — please take action before leaving town for the elections," he testified. "If Congress adjourns without extending the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) or providing other enhanced relief, more restaurants will close, more employees will lose their jobs and the pandemic economic crisis will deepen."Rodrigue said restaurants have suffered more losses in dollars and jobs than any other industry."What restaurants and their employees need is targeted help for the nation's second-largest private-sector employer," he said.Rodrigue reiterated the Association's call for Congress to consider short-term assistance like the authorization of a second round of the PPP, with greater flexibility for both operating expenses and payroll outlays. Additionally, he encouraged the Subcommittee to consider long-term tools from the Association's Blueprint for Restaurant Revival, including:Passing the Senate version of the RESTAURANTS Act, which takes a balanced approach to support independent and locally owned franchise restaurants.Ensuring that business expenses paid from PPP proceeds are tax-deductible.Enacting a refundable tax credit to cover investments in equipment and safety programs and to set up social distancing in facilities amid a crippling economic climate.Enhancing the Employee Retention Tax Credit."Restaurants and our employees have a personal connection with customers. In some towns, it's a small chain; in some towns, it's a beloved local restaurant. But every one of you, and every American, has a place that is their favorite. Regardless of the name on the door, restaurants are community cornerstones that provide a ladder of opportunity for employees," Rodrigue said.FoodserviceKEEP UP WITH WHAT’S NEW IN THE VENDING INDUSTRYSign up now for the Vending Times newsletter and get the top stories delivered straight to your inbox.SUBSCRIBE NOWPrivacy PolicyFoodserviceNRA warns Congress: foodservice industry in 'economic freefall'United Natural Foods Q1 2021 sales, earnings miss market expectationsCampbell Soup Q1 2021 sales, earnings spike driven by COVID-19Premium ContentThe Future of Consumer Self-ServiceView More On FoodserviceTOP STORIESSelf-Service Innovation Virtual Summit honors inaugural Innovation Awards winnersSelf-service enters a new era; employees take on new importanceNew virtual summit focuses on innovation, customer experience in self-service, kiosk, vending industriesNewsNRA warns Congress: foodservice industry in 'economic freefall'JM Smucker reaffirms 2021 outlookFlowers Foods promotes Heeth Varnedoe to chief transformation officerFrench farmers boost sales deploying vending machines to sell produceVending machine features elf singing Christmas songsOptConnect introduces multi-carrier cellular router for unattended devicesUnited Natural Foods Q1 2021 sales, earnings miss market expectationsMore NewsResourcesCellular Networks Driving New Retail Business ModelsThe Low Touch Economy - Going ContactlessProspering During A Pandemic: Scary Strokes Launches Embed's Mobile WalletThriving During A Pandemic: Opening A New Business & Pop-Up ArcadeNext Generation Document ReadersMore ResourcesTrendingAmusement Expo International in May features John Kriesel keynoteBiden OBM director pick supported national soda taxSelf-service enters a new era; employees take on new importanceFollowing COVID-19: How coronavirus pandemic is impacting convenience servicesFujitsu to distribute Zippin’s self-checkout solution in JapanPremium ContentThe Future of Consumer Self-Service [395]The Culture of Controls: Training, Technologies, Tools & Tactics [$299.00]Food Service Loss Prevention [$299.00]Micromarket Loss Prevention Manual [$299.00]2019 ATM Comparison Guide [$349.00$249.00]Vending Times Buyers Guide: 2019 Edition [$40.00]2019 ATM Future Trends Report [$497.00$399.00]About Us | Contact Us | Advertise | Editorial Policy | Privacy Policy | Terms Of Service | Site Map | RssUse of and/or registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms Of Service and Privacy Policy.
