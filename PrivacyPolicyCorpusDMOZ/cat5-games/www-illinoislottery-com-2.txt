Effective July 1, 2020.
INTRODUCTION
Thank you for visiting the Illinois Lottery’s website, which includes www.illinoislottery.com,  www.myillinoislottery.com, and https://m.myillinoislottery.com (collectively, the "Lottery Websites") or the Illinois Lottery's ticket purchase mobile app ("Mobile App") for any purpose (the Mobile App and the Lottery Websites collectively, the "Websites" or the "Website"). The Website Providers (defined below) recognize that you need to understand how your privacy is protected when you visit this Website. As such, the Website Providers have established this Privacy Notice. For purposes of this Privacy Notice, the "Website Providers" means the Illinois Department of the Lottery, including its agents, contractors, and any parties involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Websites or providing information related to the Websites, including, but not limited to, Camelot Illinois LLC ("Camelot Illinois") and each of their respective successors and assigns.
This Privacy Notice is subject to change at any time without notice to you by posting changes on a Website. The Website Providers encourage you to review this Privacy Notice from time to time. Your continued use of any Website following any changes made to this Privacy Notice will mean that you accept the revised Privacy Notice.
This Privacy Notice describes the Illinois Lottery's privacy practices regarding information collected from you when you visit the Websites. This Privacy Notice describes what information is collected and how that information is used. Because this Privacy Notice only applies to the Websites, if you link to another entity’s website or mobile app through a Website, you should examine that entity’s privacy notice to determine its website practices (including other state agency websites).
For purposes of this Privacy Notice, "you" or "your" means each person, group of individuals, entity or entities who visits a Website for any purpose.
For purposes of this Privacy Notice, Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") means information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. PII includes, among other information, an individual's name, address, telephone number, date of birth, password information, and any other information used to identify you on this Website. A domain name or Internet protocol address is not considered PII. PII does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.
You must be 18 years or older to use the Websites. If you attempt to purchase Illinois Lottery game tickets for Lotto, Mega Millions®, Powerball®, or any other Illinois Lottery games authorized by law to be sold via the internet ("Internet Tickets") or a subscription for specific Illinois Lottery games ("Lottery Subscription") by visiting www.illinoislottery.com,  www.myillinoislottery.com or www.m.myillinoislottery.com, the Website Providers will collect information about your Internet protocol ("IP") address via geo-filtering software. If you attempt to purchase Internet Tickets using your mobile device, precise information about your location such as longitude, latitude and radius will also be collected by the Mobile Device Geo-Location Service (Device Geo-location Service). You must check the box authorizing the Device Geo-location Service to collect precise geo-location data about your device if you want to purchase Internet Tickets. Note that you will not be authorized to purchase Internet Tickets from your mobile device if you do not authorize the collection of precise geo-location data about you.
