Privacy policy:
perplexus is owned and operated by
Animus Pactum Consulting Inc.,
a New York coropration. Anumus Pactum collects information from the
users of perplexus for the purposes of identification
and authentication while using the site.
This information currently includes a user's name, email address and homepage URL.
Animus Pactum makes this information public on the web site, as seen on the
user information page, but does not sell or otherwise distribute this information
in bulk to a third party or any other entity.
perplexus may contain Hypertext links leading to websites of
advertisers or other third parties. While viewing pages on these sites, the user may
submit personal information about themselves. This information is going to the
third parties' website, and Animus Pactum has no control nor responsibility over its use.
If you are concerned about disclosing your personal information, but wish to register
for an account anyway, you may omit your homepage URL, and use an alias instead of your
real name. You may also submit a fake email address, but in this case we will not be able
to contact you should you forget your password to the site.
(Note that when displayed on the website, the email is "spam-proofed" - so that
"you@domain.com" is shown as "you AT domain DOT com", which is easy to descifer, but
fools email-gathering spiders.)
A user can request to have their account removed and their personal information deleted
from the database by emailing to remove@perplexus.info
with their perplexus login and password.
Animus Pactum reserves the right to change the terms of this Policy with no prior
notice.
