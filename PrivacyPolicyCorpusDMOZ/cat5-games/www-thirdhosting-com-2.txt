The following terms of service (these "Terms of Service" or this “Agreement”) govern the provision by THIRD GENERATION INTERNET SERVICES ("Third Generation") to the customer executing this online transaction ("Customer"), of the products and services described in the Order Form submitted in connection with this online transaction (the “Order Form”). These Terms of Service shall be effective as of the date that Customer executes its online transaction and thereby accepts these Terms of Services (the “Effective Date”). These Terms of Service hereby incorporate by reference Third Generation’s Acceptable Usage Policy (as in effect from time to time as set forth on Third Generation’s website, the “AUP”) and the Order Form each of which is made a part of these Terms of Service and collectively referred to herein as the “Agreement”. Capitalized terms used herein without being defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such capitalized term in the AUP, as applicable. Customer’s use of
Third Generation’s website, Third Generation Network, and the Products and Services is also subject to Customer’s acceptance and compliance with Third Generation’s Privacy Policy which Third Generation hereby reserves the right to amend, alter, modify, replace or suspend, from time to time in its sole discretion. Current copies of Third Generation’s AUP and Privacy Policy may be reviewed or printed by Customer at the Legal section of Third Generation’s website. CUSTOMER HEREBY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THE AUP AND PRIVACY POLICY.
NOTWITHSTANDING, BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN AS WELL AS ALL ACCEPTABLE USE POLICIES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.
Third Generation reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, any Addendums and any policy or guideline incorporated by reference at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, and to determine whether and when any such changes apply to both existing or future customers. Any changes or modification will be effective upon posting of the revisions on the Third Generation Web site (the "Site"). Your continued use of Services following Third Generation's posting of any changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.
1. Term and Payment for Services
1.1 Term
This Agreement shall be for an "Initial Term" as chosen by you in the Order Form located on this Site at the time you register for the Services. This Agreement will be automatically renewed (the "Renewal Term") at the end of the Initial Term for the same period as the Initial Term unless you provide Third Generation with notice of termination two (2) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term. You must provide Third Generation with your notice of termination by clicking on the "Request Cancellation" button located on the Site or as otherwise provided by this Agreement. Upon clicking on the "Request Cancellation" button, you may be asked to provide Third Generation with sufficient customer identification information so that Third Generation may properly identify you and your account. Any notice of termination will be effective following two (2) days after Third Generation's receipt thereof.
1.2 Termination Policy
If you terminate your receipt of the Services prior to the end of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, whichever is then applicable, (i) Third Generation will not refund to you any fees paid in advance of such termination and (ii) you shall be required to pay 100% of Third Generation's standard monthly charge for each month remaining in the term, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you terminate your receipt of the Services prior to the end of the first thirty (30) days of the Initial Term, you are entitled to a refund of the fees you paid in advance for the monthly Services, not including any set-up fees, domain registration fees or domain related fees. Your termination request or notice must be submitted to Third Generation in the manner described in Section 1.1. Third Generation may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason by providing to you written notice five (5) days prior to the date of termination.
If Third Generation terminates this Agreement, Third Generation will refund to you the pro-rata portion of pre-paid fees attributable to Services, excluding set-up fees, domain registration fees and domain related fees, not yet rendered as of the termination date unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.
1.3 Default and Cure
In the event that either party hereto defaults in the performance of any of its material duties or obligations under this Agreement, including failure to make any payments due under this Agreement, and such default is not cured within five (5) days after written notice is given to the defaulting party specifying the default, then the party not in default, after given written notice thereof to the defaulting party, may terminate this Agreement.
1.4. Charges
You agree to pay for all charges attributable to your use of the Services at the then current Third Generation prices, which shall be exclusive of any applicable taxes. You are responsible for the payment of all federal, state, and local sales, use, value added, excise, duty and any other taxes assessed with respect to the Services, other than taxes based on Third Generation's net income.
1.5 Payment
All charges for Services must be paid in advance according to the then current prices applicable to the Services. Upon entering this Agreement, you must choose to pay either by direct charge to a credit or debit card, or receive an invoice and submit subsequent payment. If you choose to pay by credit or debit card upon registering for the Services, you thereby authorize Third Generation to charge your credit or debit card to pay for any charges that may apply to your account. You must notify Third Generation of any changes to your card account (including, without limitation, applicable account number or cancellation or expiration of the account), your billing address, or any information that may prohibit Third Generation from charging your account. If you choose to be invoiced upon
registration for Services, Third Generation will invoice you for the Services applicable to the period for which you have registered for the Services. You agree to pay to Third Generation the amount indicated in each invoice by the due date reflected on that invoice. Failure to fully pay any fees and taxes within five (5) days after the applicable due date will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, and Third Generation may, in addition to any other remedy, suspend its
performance of the Services and/or terminate this Agreement. Any such suspension or termination of the Services would not relieve you from paying past due fees plus interest. In the event of collection enforcement, you will be liable for any costs associated with such collection, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees.
2. Use of Services
2.1 Applicable Use Policy

THIRD GENERATION RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT FOR ANY VIOLATION OF THE USAGE POLICY OR THIS AGREEMENT.
2.2 Material and Product Requirements
Unless agreed otherwise in a separate agreement between the Customer and Third Generation, the Customer must ensure that all material and data placed on Third Generation's equipment is in a condition that is "server-ready," which is in a form requiring no additional manipulation by Third Generation. Third Generation will make no effort to validate any of this information for content, correctness or usability. If your material is not "server-ready", Third Generation has the option at any time to reject this material. Third Generation will notify you of its refusal of the material and afford you the opportunity to amend or modify the material to satisfy the needs and/or requirements of Third Generation. Use of the Services requires a certain level of knowledge in the use of Internet languages, protocols and software. This level of knowledge varies depending on the anticipated use and desired content of your Web site. You must have the necessary knowledge to create and maintain a Web site.
It is not Third Generation's responsibility to provide this knowledge or customer support outside of the Services agreed to by you and Third Generation.
2.3 Bandwidth Usage
You agree that use of the Services under this Agreement will not exceed the bandwidth usage limits set out. If you use any bandwidth in excess of the agreed upon number of “megabytes” or “gigabytes” per month, you agree to pay the associated additional charges or may elect to have the Services of your account suspended for the remainder of the Initial or Renewal Term. Third Generation maintains the responsibility to notify you in writing of excessive usage and notify you before suspension of your Services or additional charges are incurred.
