We may also collect additional non-personally identifiable information, such as pages viewed, browser type, duration and frequency of visits, and other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual as further described below. Information from You is gathered on Our Service through the use of online forms, site visit data and automatic online collection devices (known as "cookies" or “click-stream data”). Cookies are small bits of text that are either used for the duration of a session ("session cookies") or saved on Your computer's hard drive in order to identify You, or information about You, so Your continuing experience with a website over time can be personalized ("persistent cookies"). Session cookies are automatically deleted when You close Your browser; persistent cookies are stored on Your computer until You delete them. As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit, i.e. “click-stream data”. We may collect and use click-stream data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Service, how visitors navigate throughout the Service and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.
