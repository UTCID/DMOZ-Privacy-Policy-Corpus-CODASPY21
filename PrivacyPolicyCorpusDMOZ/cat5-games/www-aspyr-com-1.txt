YOUR LICENSE TO US
Unless specifically stated otherwise in the rules or guidelines applicable to the specific Service, user-submitted Communications remain the intellectual property of the individual user. By submitting or posting Communications to the Website, you automatically grant Aspyr an unrestricted, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Communications and your name, voice, and/or likeness as included in your Communication, in whole or in part, and in any form throughout the world in any media or technology, whether now known or hereafter discovered, including all promotion, advertising, marketing, merchandising, publicity and any other ancillary uses thereof, and including the unfettered right to sublicense such rights, in perpetuity throughout the universe, all without notice to you, and with or without attribution. You agree that any Communications you make are not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way.
UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS
Aspyr does not knowingly accept or consider unsolicited submissions including but not limited to any creative or technical concepts, ideas, plots, scripts, drawings, games, suggestions, know-how or techniques (collectively, Submissions). At any given time Aspyr staff is working on various projects and initiatives for new products and services that might seem to others to be similar to their own creative or technical work. Our policy is to destroy or delete any unsolicited Submission without reading it, or when feasible, arrange for designated staff who do not have creative responsibilities or our attorneys to return it to you without reviewing or considering the contents except to the minimal extent necessary to ascertain that it is an unsolicited Submission. In accordance with our policy, no unsolicited Submission will be forwarded to or reviewed by any other Aspyr staff. Therefore, any similarity between an unsolicited Submission and any elements in any Aspyr creative or technical work would be purely coincidental. In addition, any unsolicited submission you may send will be treated as non-confidential, and Aspyr will not be liable for any disclosure of such submission.
If, notwithstanding the above, you violate these Terms of Use and transmit unsolicited Submissions to us through the Website or through any other means, such Submissions become the property of Aspyr and may be adapted, broadcast, modified, copied, disclosed, licensed, performed, distributed, posted, published, sold, transmitted, or otherwise used as Aspyr, in its sole discretion, sees fit. You agree that you are not entitled to any compensation, credit or notice whatsoever and that by sending an unsolicited Submission you waive the right to make any claim against Aspyr or any of our parents, affiliates, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders, relating to unsolicited Submissions, including, but not limited to, unfair competition, breach of implied contract or breach of confidentiality. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively own all now-known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submission for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without any compensation to the provider of the Submission.
If you would like to discuss a creative or technical idea, suggestion or concept with Aspyr or propose a potential business relationship, please contact us through our regular points of contact to the public with a non-confidential communication indicating your interest and withhold your Submission until we have entered into a written agreement with you setting forth each of our rights and obligations with respect to any resulting disclosures or discussions.
INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Aspyr, and its respective affiliates, employees, officers, and directors from and against any and all claims, liability, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with your use or alleged use of the Website, including your conduct, and any Communications and/or content that you contribute to the Website, and any breach of these Terms of Use or any EULA.
