This is in the legitimate interests of Firefly and to comply with a legal obligation around fraud prevention which is in our legitimate interests to protect ourselves and other gamers from fraudulent and anti-social activity.
If you have been banned from the Game then the following shall also apply.
We will retain an encrypted version of your email address for the sole purpose of preventing you from creating a new gaming account. We will retain no access to the email address and it can therefore not be used for any other purpose.

You have the right to object to processing on the grounds that it causes you damage or distress and the right to take away a copy of your personal data in electronic format in certain circumstances.
We do not rely on consent as a basis for processing. We provide this privacy notice which explains our use of personal data and the grounds we rely on.

All the personal data we hold is supplied ultimately by our gamers. Some of it may come to us indirectly from Google play, Apple i-Tunes, Steam, Microsoft store and other providers of leads. We obtain very limited personal data from third parties. Most of the personal data we hold is provided directly by you when you create an online account.
There is automated decision making in the gaming system. Your ability to purchase game in-game currency is limited depending on the time you have spent in the game, this is for fraud prevention purposes. We also have automatic lock out on accounts from shared IP addresses in line with our game rules to prevent players using multiple accounts.
