Stanford Center for Professional Development
The Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD), a pioneer in online and extended education,  has returned home to the School of Engineering, where it was originally established in 1995. SCPD works with Stanford faculty, departments, schools, and centers to develop and deliver engaging, high-quality online, in-person, and blended learning experiences to learners around the world.
SCPD operates and manages Stanford Online, the university’s online learning platform, offering learners access to Stanford’s extended education and lifelong learning opportunities both on campus and around the world.
Stanford Center for Health Education
We work in close collaboration with the Stanford Center for Health Education (SCHE), a part of Stanford Medicine, helping extend health education to a global community of health professionals and to communities around the world, creating a more informed public, and improving health outcomes in some of the world’s most vulnerable populations.
Learning Technologies and Spaces
VPTL’s Learning Technologies and Spaces is now part of the Office of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs (VPSA).
