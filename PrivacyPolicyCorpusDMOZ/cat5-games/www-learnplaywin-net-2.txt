Accessing the Service, in any manner, for the purpose of obtaining information, technical or otherwise, about the Service, constitutes use of the Service and your agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change these Terms of Service or impose new conditions on use of the Service, from time to time, in which case we will post the revised Terms of Service on this website. By continuing to use the LearnPlayWin.net website after we post any such changes, you accept the Terms of Service, as modified.

Online Purchases on or through LearnPlayWin.net:
Certain sections of the LearnPlayWin.net website may allow you to purchase many different types of products and services online that are provided by third parties. LearnPlayWin.net is not responsible for the quality, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or any other aspect of these products and services. If you make a purchase from a merchant on the LearnPlayWin.net website or a site linked to by LearnPlayWin.net, the information obtained during your visit to that merchant’s online store or site and the information that you give as part of the transaction, such as your credit card number and contact information, may be collected by both the merchant and LearnPlayWin.net. A merchant may have privacy and data collection practices that are different from ours. LearnPlayWin.net has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. In addition, when you purchase products or services on or through the LearnPlayWin.net website, you may be subject to additional terms and conditions that specifically apply to your purchase or use of such products or services. For more information regarding a merchant, its online store, its privacy policies and/or any additional terms and conditions that may apply, visit that merchant’s website and click on its information links or contact the merchant directly. You release LearnPlayWin.net from any damages that you incur, and agree not to assert any claims against them, arising from your purchase or use of any products or services made available by third parties through the LearnPlayWin.net website.
You agree to be financially responsible for all purchases made by you or someone acting on your behalf through the Service. You agree to use the Service and to purchase services or products through the Service for legitimate, non-commercial purposes only. You also agree not to make any purchases for speculative, false or fraudulent purposes or for the purpose of anticipating demand for a particular product or service. You agree to only purchase goods or services for yourself or for another person for whom you are legally permitted to do so. When making a purchase for a third party that requires you to submit the third party’s personal information to LearnPlayWin.net or a merchant, you represent that you have obtained the express consent of such third party to provide such third party’s personal information.
LearnPlayWin.net is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

Limitation of Liability:
Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall LearnPlayWin.net be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use, LearnPlayWin.net materials, products, or services, third party materials, products, or services made available through LearnPlayWin.net, or any part of the Service even if LearnPlayWin.net is advised beforehand of the possibility of such damages. (Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages, the above limitation may not apply to you. In such states, the liability of LearnPlayWin.net is limited to the fullest extent permitted by such state law.) You specifically acknowledge and agree that LearnPlayWin.net is not liable for any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of any user.

Other:
This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between LearnPlayWin.net and you with respect to the subject matter contained in this agreement and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals and communications, written or oral. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use the products or services of a third party that are provided through the Service. In the event of any conflict between any such third party terms and conditions and these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service shall govern. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia without giving effect to any principles or conflicts of law. If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
