Terms of Use
AFFILIATESNetwork N often works with affiliate partners to drive activity to online services or e-commerce purchases (e.g. iTunes) in exchange for a commission. This partnership is presented as editorial links and buttons across our sites. While we receive review samples, all coverage of products is independent. These links do not influence editorial decisions in any way. They only appear in articles related to the product in question and use neutral language, for example: “Order [this game] from the [Place]” or "Play Now for Free!".A list of currently active affiliate partnerships is available here.ANALYTICSWe’ve implemented Google Analytics based on Display Advertising (e.g. Re-marketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).Network N Ltd and third-party vendors, including Google, will use this remarking information and data based on previous visits to our site to serve relevant messages across the web.You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s Ads Settings.Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.COOKIESNetwork N Ltd uses cookies on its websites in order to provide enhanced functionality to users, such as user accounts and saved preferences.
