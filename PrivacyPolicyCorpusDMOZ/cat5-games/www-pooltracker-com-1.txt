Tie games: How are tie games handled?
Tie games
For pickem, survivor and streak pools without tie game selectors, tie games or draws are treated as wins, for anyone who makes a pick. This only applies to pools that are not scored against-the-spread (ATS).
For pools with tie game selectors, only players who correctly predict tie games will be awarded points.
Note: If no winner was picked for the game, then it is treated as an incorrect pick.
Cancelled games: How do postponed/cancelled games affect scoring?
A cancelled game is one that will not be played in a reasonable timeframe like the other games on the original picks sheet.
ie. If a game was originally supposed to be played in week 1, but, gets moved to week 12, then it is considered "cancelled" for week 1.
If the "tie breaker" game is cancelled, then the next latest played game will be used.
A postponed game is one where the start time is changed, but, is still played in a reasonable timeframe like the other games. ie. the same "week".
The scheduled start time for postponed games will be changed on the picks page.
It is up to each player to make a pick before the new start time.
If the rescheduled start time affects that week's tie breaker then the rescheduled game will be used as the tie breaker.
eg. If the original tie breaker game is on Monday night and the rescheduled game is played Tuesday, then the Tuesday game will be the tie breaker game.
Cancelled Games for Pickem-style pools
Pickem scores for cancelled games:
Everyone gets a win, for cancelled games, no matter who they picked, as long as they made a pick.
The game will NOT be locked prior to its originally scheduled start time.
So, everyone has a fair chance to make a pick.
People in pools with ranking type scoring methods will get credit for a win and receive their ranking points,
as long as they made a pick with a ranking.
Pool admins can change picks/rankings as necessary.
One option, that some admins, with ranking-style scoring methods, have employed is to
bump everyone's rankings up by 1, that were originally below the postponed game ranking, and set their postponed rank to zero.
Eg. If a player had assigned 3 ranking points to the postponed game, then set that to zero
and the game, for that player, that was ranked 2, would be changed to 3 and the game that player had as a 1 would be changed to a 2.
Please note, that this remedy may not work for ranking style pools, where losses count negative, because a loss could be increased,
which may unfairly decrease that player's score.
Eg. If a player originally ranked a loss as a 2, then you bump that game to a 3, then they will have negative 3 points, instead of negative 2 points.
Cancelled Games for Survivor / Streak style pools
Survivor / Streak scores for cancelled games:
Once an official announcement has been made that a game is cancelled, that game will be "locked" to prevent any more survivor/streak picks being made.
Anyone who picks either of those 2 teams will get a win.
Pool admins can change picks as necessary.

Tie Breakers: How are tie breakers calculated?
Summary of how tie breakers are calculated, for pickem pools:
Basically, the system keeps track of how close each person got, each week (or stage).  It then sums up each person's weekly difference, to get the season long difference.  The person with the lowest season long difference, wins the tie breaker.
Details of Weekly Tie Breakers are calculated as follows:
If multiple players are tied for the highest points for any given week, the player with the closest tie breaker prediction, regardless if they are over or under, to the actual tie breaker value is the winner. If multiple players are still tied, then the player who entered their tie breaker value first*, wins.
* = The player with the earliest date/timestamp for enterring their picks.
Please note that the date/timestamp is updated every time a player's picks and/or tie breaker are edited.
The season-long tie breaker, for "pickem-style" pools is the sum of all the tie breaker differences for each week. The goal is to have the smallest "difference,".. ie. the closest "difference" to zero, will win the season long tie breaker. Should multiple players be tied at the end of a season, then the player with the smallest total difference will be the winner.
Ex. for a 3 week season:
Player A and Player B are tied after the entire season.  But, in the scenario below, Player B wins, because B has a smaller tie breaker difference than A.
Week 1:
Actual Tie Breaker Value: 30
Player A predicts 28:  30 - 28 = a difference of 2
Player B predicts 26:  30 - 26 = a difference of 4
Week 2:
Actual Tie Breaker Value: 21
Player A predicts 28:  28 - 21 = a difference of 7
Player B predicts 26:  26 - 21 = a difference of 5
Week 3:
Actual Tie Breaker Value: 45
Player A predicts 49:  49 - 45 = a difference of 4
Player B predicts 45:  45 - 45 = a difference of 0
Total Tie Breaker Difference calculation:
Player A:  2 + 7 + 4 = 13
Player B: 4 + 5 + 0 = 9
Conclusion:
Player B wins the tie breaker
