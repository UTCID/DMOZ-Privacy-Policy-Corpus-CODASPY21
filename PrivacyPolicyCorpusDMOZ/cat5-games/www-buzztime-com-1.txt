You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in San Diego County, California, USA, and you agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action WaiverPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.You and Buzztime agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.This section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Buzztime as follows:Initial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach Buzztime’s support department at techsupportreps@buzztime.com. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the Buzztime support department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy’s formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (b) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco California 94111; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at NTN Buzztime, Inc., 6965 El Camino Real, Suite 105 #517, Carlsbad, CA 92009.To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Buzztime will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Buzztime will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America, and you and Buzztime agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Diego County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND BUZZTIME AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you use on Buzztime) written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@buzztime.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the effective date of these Terms for existing users or within thirty (30) days your first use of the Services for new users. Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Buzztime also will not be bound by them.Changes to this Section: Buzztime will provide sixty (60) days’ notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Buzztime website. Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to this Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.Survival: This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Services.ModificationExcept in regards to the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provision in these Terms, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Services or by sending you notice through the Services, via email or by another appropriate means of electronic communication. We may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. While we will timely provide notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following notification of any changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes, which will apply to your continued use of the Services going forward. Your use of the Services is subject to the Terms in effect at the time of such use.Mobile Device and Application TermsIn the event you are accessing the Services via a Buzztime mobile application on a device provided by Apple, Inc. or a Buzztime app obtained through the Apple App Store or Google Play (in either case, an “application”), the following shall apply:Both you and Buzztime acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Buzztime only, and not with Apple or Google, and that Apple and Google are not responsible for any applications or the Services.The application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services.You will only use the application in connection with the device that you own or control.You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the application.In the event of any failure of the application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the application.You acknowledge and agree that Buzztime, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the application.You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the application or your possession and use of the application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Buzztime, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim.You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.Both you and Buzztime acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms which may affect or be affected by such use.Both you and Buzztime acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these terms, and that upon your acceptance of these terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.GeneralYou agree these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Buzztime and governs your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and Buzztime. If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in force. The failure of Buzztime to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Buzztime shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.These Terms are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. No modification of or addition to these Terms shall be effective unless in writing and signed by an executive officer of Buzztime.Except as expressly set forth herein, all notices must be sent to the following address:Via Certified Mail:NTN Buzztime, Inc.
