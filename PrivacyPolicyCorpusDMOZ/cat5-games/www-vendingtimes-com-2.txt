We appreciate the trust you place in us when you enter your contact info into a form on our site. We do not take that trust for granted and have implemented the following policies to protect your data and privacy.
When you fill out a form on our site, you will be added to these lists…
Email Newsletters – We will deliver content from our site to your inbox several times a week. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of every issue.

The data we collect will not be shared without your consent.
We only collect data about you from a professional context. This includes, but is not limited to, your email address, company name, job title, etc. We will not sell or share this data to anyone without your explicit consent.
In specific cases, we will be contractually obligated to share your data with one of our third-party advertisers, sponsors or partners (for example, webinars, downloads or events). In these instances, we will make it clear that the data you share will be transferred to the third party. You will always have the option to not have your data shared by not taking part in that specific program.
We use third-party data processors.
