Chessgames.com Privacy Notice
Your privacy is very important to Chessgames.com.
While we gather information about our users
to help provide the best service possible,
we adhere to strict policies to safeguard your privacy
at all times. This page states, in plain language, our privacy policy,
so that there may be no misunderstandings about what information we gather,
and why we gather it.
Information gathered: When you register an account with chessgames.com,
you will have access to a preferences page
which allows you to provide various information, including your email address.
All information you submit on this page, with the exception of your "username" and your "bio,"
is completely confidential.
We will never give or sell your email address
to any third party.
We will never reveal your address to other users.
We will occasionally email all registered members
with newsletters that announce new features, games and puzzles,
and special promotions.
If you prefer not to receive
our emails, either check the option that reads "Do not send me emails, newsletters, etc."
on your preferences
page or email chess@chessgames.com
with your request.
Chessgames.com uses standard web logfiles, which automatically record all requests made of
the chessgames.com servers.
Such information includes I.P. addresses, the chessgames.com
pages requested, the type of browser you use, etc. We study these data in aggregate in order
to try to understand our customers' preferences better and to improve our site.
Your "Bio": Your preferences page has an area we
call the "bio" where you may voluntarily provide information about yourself.
The purpose of
this feature is to introduce yourself to other members.
You are not obligated to write
anything in this area.
Whatever information you volunteer in your "bio" will be visible
to all other members of the site.
We caution against including your email address in your bio, because email-harvesting
spiders (a.k.a. "spambots") may extract your email from this page for the purpose of sending
you junk email.
Cookies: "Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us
to recognize you.
If your browser accepts cookies, you will receive a chessgames.com cookie
the first time you visit our site.
This cookie allows us to customize the site's behavior
and appearance to fit your tastes.
We do not use the cookie for any other purpose.
You are
able to erase your cookie at any time by visiting the logout
page which will wipe out our chessgames cookie until you choose to sign-in again.
Children: Chessgames.com is proud to maintain a decorum suitable for children, and
children of all ages are very much welcomed here.
However, when a child under age 13
registers with chessgames.com, we suggest that a parent is present to prevent the child from
inadvertently volunteering sensitive information.
Information Security: Chessgames.com is committed to
handling your customer billing information with the highest possible
standards of information security.
All credit card information is
transmitted through the industry standard SSL-encrypted secure channel.
If you send us credit card information to register for
premium membership, that information is stored only in
the server's RAM memory, and not on the permanent storage device.
Once the transaction is completed, that area of our server's
RAM is intentionally wiped out.
Therefore, it is
impossible for a criminal to steal your credit
card number from us, because we don't have it.
We do, however,
retain the last 4 digits of your credit card number in the event
that it may be required for proof of identification.
We will never automatically rebill you for services; we
will however email you 30 days prior to the expiration
of your account and encourage you to renew your
subscription.
If you choose to renew, you will have to
enter your credit card information again.
Chessgames will never ask you for your password, your credit card, or any other sensitive
information via email. If you receive an email apparently from us requesting sensitive information,
it is a forgery.
In such an event, we suggest you do not
reply to the email, but instead forward it to chess@chessgames.com for investigation.
More Information: If you have any other questions
about chessgames.com's privacy policy, feel
free to write us at chess@chessgames.com
and we will be happy to address whatever concerns you have.
