Online Privacy Policy of BlitWise Productions
LLC
This document sets forth the Online Privacy
Policy (the "Policy") of BlitWise Productions LLC
("BlitWise"). This Policy describes the ways we
collect, store, use, and manage the information, including
personally identifiable information, that you provide or we
collect in connection with our websites, including www.BlitWise.com and classic.BlitWise.com
(the "Site") or any BlitWise game or software provided
on any platform (Apple's iOS App Store, Google Play, our own
site, etc) (collectively, the "Service"). If you
have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access
or use the Service. This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy
practices associated with offline activities or the collection
of information other than through the Site. Your use of the
Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy
and consent to the terms herein.
BlitWise is committed to safeguarding the
privacy of Users of the Service. We will use our best efforts
to ensure that the information you provide us remains private
and is used only for the purposes set forth herein. Additionally,
in no event will BlitWise sell customer lists or profiles
to outside sources.
Changes in Privacy Policy
All "personal information" ("personal
information" is defined as any information that identifies
or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person
to whom such information pertains, examples being names, street
addresses, email address, billing address, credit card number
and expiration dates) that we collect and maintain will be
subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at
the time of such collection. BlitWise reserves the right to
change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion.
Please note that if BlitWise sells assets
(or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity,
or BlitWise (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by,
or merged with, another entity, BlitWise may provide to such
entity customer and personal information that is related to
that part of our business that was sold to or merged with
the other entity without your consent.
Third Parties
The Service contains links to other sites
or services at which personal information is collected. If
you access such sites or services, the collection and use
of your personal information will not be governed by this
Privacy Policy but by the privacy policy applicable to that
service, unless expressly provided to the contrary. That privacy
policy should identify the entity that is collecting your
personal information. Because BlitWise does not control the
privacy practices of third parties you are subject to the
privacy customs and policies of those third parties. When
you link to another website, you are subject to the privacy
policy of that website. We encourage you to ask questions
and review the applicable privacy policy before you disclose
your personal information to third parties. We do not try
to control, and disclaim responsibility for, information provided
by other Users or third parties that is made available through
our Service. Such information may contain errors, intentional
or otherwise, or may be inappropriate or inaccurate and in
some cases will be mislabeled.
Collection of personal information
As a User of our Service, You can engage in
many activities without providing any personal information.
In connection with other activities, such as requesting information,
downloading games, or participating in the forum discussions,
BlitWise may ask You to provide certain information about
yourself by filling out and submitting a form. It is completely
optional for You to engage in these activities. If you elect
to engage in these activities, however, BlitWise may ask that
You provide us personal information, such as your first and
last name, company name, mailing address (including ZIP code),
email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other
personal information. Depending upon the activity, some of
the information that we ask You to provide is identified as
mandatory and some as voluntary. If You do not provide the
mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, You
will not be able to engage in that activity.
When You use the Service, BlitWise or third
parties authorized by BlitWise, may also collect certain technical
and routing information about your computer or mobile device
to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example,
we may log environmental variables, such as browser type,
operating system, CPU speed, the Internet Protocol ("IP")
address of your computer, unique device ID, hardware type,
media access control ("MAC") address, or device
name. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and
track your use of the Site and its services. BlitWise also
uses such environmental variables for troubleshooting and
to measure usage patterns of the Service. Without expressly
informing You, we do not match such information with any of
your personal information.
When you use the Service, your BlitWise identification
or avatar may be visible to the public depending upon the
nature of the Service You use. You may use a variety of identities
without revealing your primary identification by creating
an avatar or alias. An avatar consists of a name and some
information that you show in a profile to other users on BlitWise.
When creating such profile please be mindful that such information
is available to all online.
When You submit personal information to BlitWise
through this Service, You understand and agree that this information
may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored
and processed in any of the countries in which BlitWise and
its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including,
without limitation, the United States of America. You also
acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain
activities, authorized vendors of BlitWise may undertake the
collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your
information. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use
your personal information for their own purposes or provide
it to any third parties. One instance where this could occur
is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the
pages is not visible and the pages are being hosted by a vendor
of BlitWise.
Authentication and Push Notifications
If You choose to sign up for an account for
any part of BlitWise's Service using a third party (such as
Twitter, Facebook, etc.), BlitWise may use that party's oAuth
authentication information. This may include a unique oAuth
token, a Facebook user number, or Twitter account name. BlitWise
will not have access to your account password, and will not
communicate information to Third Party servers except communication
with user configured services such as Facebook and Twitter
as outlined in this Policy.
Some parts of the Service may seek to send
Push notifications to your device. When activating, your device
may ask permission to send you notifications. If You refuse,
no further information will be taken for purposes of notification.
If you agree, we will register You on our servers to receive
notifications. When registering for notifications, some identification
is collected from your client. This may include an anonymous
device identifier, your username, and a client push notification
identifier (provided by your device OS, including but not
limited to Apple, Windows, or Android).
Notifications may be processed through a contracted
service provider, such as Parse. When You receive a notification,
it may be processed through their servers, as well as the
servers for your device's push notifications (such as Apple's
iOS APS)
Parse may monitor the feedback servers dedicated
to your device through Apple, etc. If You uninstall a BlitWise
product, they will remove your account information from our
database in a timely fashion.
Policies For Children
BlitWise does not knowingly collect or use
any personal information from Users under 13 years of age
without express parental consent pursuant to the Children's
On-line Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (hereinafter COPPA).
Once verifiable parental consent is obtained by BlitWise,
the personal information is treated no differently than adult
users, in that in no event will BlitWise sell customer lists
or profiles.
Pursuant to COPPA, prior to submitting verifiable
parental consent the parents of children under 13 years of
age have the right to receive information describing the specific
types of personal information to be collected by the site.
Additionally, a parent has the right at any time to refuse
to permit (1) the operator's further use or maintenance of
the child's personal information in retrievable form, and/or
(2) further online collection of personal information from
that child.
BlitWise has the ability to terminate service,
pursuant to COPPA to a child whose parent has refused to permit
the operator's further use or maintenance in retrievable form,
or future online collection of personal information from such
child.
Finally, BlitWise will not condition a child's
participation in a game, offering of a prize, or any other
activity upon the child disclosing more personal information
than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.
Use of Personal Information
BlitWise collects your information in order
to record and support your participation in the activities
you select. For example, if you subscribe to a forum or download
a game, the information is used to register your rights, if
any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made
available to registered Users. Your personal information is
also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special
offers, and other products and services of BlitWise and selected
third parties if You have so opted to receive such communications.

communications.
BlitWise may collect information about the

in aggregate form, without identifying any User individually.
BlitWise may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical
data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional
purposes.
BlitWise will comply with all local and international
law. We may release your information as permitted or required
by law, and to enforce or apply our rights. This may include
protecting the rights and safety of our users and exchange
of information with other organizations for purposes of preventing
fraud.
