"Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you have a Dispute with any of the Parties that cannot be resolved through negotiation within the time frame described in the "Notice of Dispute" clause below, you and the Company Entity that you have a Dispute with agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this section, and not litigate any Dispute in court, except for those matters listed as an exclusion below. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.YOU AND THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY A COMPANY ENTITY IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.If you have a dispute with any Company Entity, you must send written notice to [GameWorks Inc., Attn: Legal, 5670 Wilshire Blvd.,
18th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036] to give the Company Entity that you have a dispute with opportunity to resolve the dispute informally through negotiation. You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If the Company Entity you have a Dispute with does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from receipt of Notice of Dispute, you or the Company Entity you have a Dispute with may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this section.ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE COMPANY ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION. THIS PROVISION IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE EXTENT THIS WAIVER IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.All disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in San Francisco County, California in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), which are available on the AAA website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of AAA or waive your opportunity to read the rules of AAA and any claim that the rules of AAA are unfair or should not apply for any reason. You and the Company agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA“) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and the Company will not have the right to assert the claim.IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Any dispute between the parties that are not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco County, California.  MiscellaneousIf any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company relating to your access to and use of our Services.

By participating in any GameWorks online esports, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms & Conditions, and your use shall be subject to these Terms & Conditions, as they may be amended from time to time, and without notice. You can obtain the latest version of these Terms & Conditions on our website at www.gameworks.com/terms-and-conditions.Prizing DocumentationFor a US citizen or resident, the threshold for issuing Form 1099-MISC (miscellaneous income) to report prize winnings to the recipient and the Internal Revenue Service is $600 per calendar year. In order to facilitate the issuance of such Form 1099-MISC, historically, we have tried to collect Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, from each tournament winner upon first dollar payout, regardless of whether online or in-venue, which has created some friction in organizing tournaments and in some cases has resulted in some players withdrawing. In an attempt to balance reducing barriers to entry to maximize our reach and audience and our compliance responsibilities, effective immediately we will be implementing the following practices: US Players Collecting Form W-9 is to be deferred until a player cumulatively reaches the $600 reporting threshold for a calendar year. Operations and finance personnel will share responsibility for tracking tournament prize winners and their cumulative winnings based (an) appropriate unique identifier(s) as determined by the team organizing and running the tournaments. A member of the finance/operations team will reach out to the tournament prize winner and request a completed Form W-9 when that player wins an amount, which will push his/her cumulative earnings over the reporting threshold. If the prize-winner elects not to comply with the request to provide a completed Form W-9, their most-recent winnings will be withheld until a completed Form W-9 is furnished or forfeited. Tax reporting is done annually through issuing Form 1099-MISC to the prize winners exceeding the reporting thresholds who have provided Form W-9 documentation. Expectations of eventual documentation and reporting requirements should be set with all players when they sign up. Non-US Players Unlike prize payouts to US citizens or residents, which are not reportable until the $600 threshold is met, prize winnings payable to non-US resident/citizen players are reportable at any level of payout and generally subject to US withholding tax at 30% of the gross prize winnings. As the payor of the prize winnings, we are the withholding agent and responsible for holding back the US withholding tax from the non-US prize winner and remitting it to the IRS on a timely basis. As the withholding agent, we are responsible for collecting from the prize winner Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals). Form W-8BEN is similar to a W-9 but used exclusively by non-US persons to declare their US tax status. A member of the finance/operations team will reach out to the prize winner and request a completed Form W-8BEN before any prize winnings are paid out. Finance will calculate the withholding tax and inform operations of the net prize payout to send to a winner via PayPal. Annual tax reporting includes issuing Form 1042-S, Foreign Person’s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding to each prize winner who is not a US citizen or resident and filing Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source of Income of Foreign Person for each recipient and filing it with the IRS. Expectations of eventual documentation and reporting requirements should be set with all players when they sign up. In addition to tax reporting, introducing non-US players to online tournaments will require GameWorks to start monitoring entrance fee levels by jurisdiction to determine when we are reaching levels that would trigger consideration of indirect tax reporting requirements.   Should you need assistance with these Terms and Conditions, please contact info@gameworks.com
