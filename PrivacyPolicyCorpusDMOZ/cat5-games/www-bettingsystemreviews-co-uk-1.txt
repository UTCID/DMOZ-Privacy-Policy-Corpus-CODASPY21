You are all warmly invited to tell us about your football betting strategy, how you win your football bets (or bets on other sports), and we will then publish it here (if you wish anonymously) to be shared with other punters. Anonymity, if requested, will of course be respected. Feel free to share your own fixed odds football betting systems that work with our betting community!
To boost your motivation in sharing your successful betting systems, we have organised £7.50 worth of free betting vouchers!
Everyone who sends us their best betting strategy (and meets the criteria mentioned below) will be entered into a quarterly draw, the result of which, we shall distribute those betting vouchers from. The draw is necessary to give all submissions which meet our criteria, a fair chance of obtaining a voucher. This ensures that only the quality betting strategy submissions make their way onto our pages.
Conditions for the betting voucher:
Your sports betting strategy should be detailed and creative with a minimum of 250 words
We would like to hear more than just a few lines like ‘I bet if I have a good feeling about a team and they are the favourites …’
Submissions need to be written in plain, concise English.
It goes without saying that the football betting strategy must be written by yourself and must not be copied from internet (forum, etc.)
Mere money management strategies (like staking systems, or progression systems, …) do not get rewarded. (No Martingale, no D’Alembert etc)
We are looking for real inventive selection methods, betting styles, …
If you’ve been having a go at being a successful punter, then you’ve no doubt seen all the advertisements for betting strategies that are sure to make you a winner. Yet which betting strategy is best of all? All of them make so many promises, so how can you tell the sure bets from the sure fails?
The answer is that there is no one betting strategy that is going to guarantee you success. A wager is just that – a wager. Nothing is guaranteed. Any betting system which promises 100% success every time is likely to be a scam or a fraud.
However, there are some strategies that can help you increase your winnings. Most of these strategies involve something that is very hard for the average punter to perform, and something which can be a challenge for even the most successful sports investor. It’s discipline. All strategies have rules, but many people find it hard to stick to the rules when something just “feels” right. When gut instinct kicks in, discipline can fly out of the window.
Football betting strategies, golf betting strategies, horse race strategies, basketball betting strategies – all of these strategies are only as good as the person following the rules. If you are hunting for that perfect football betting strategy but you can’t even stick to your diet, then you are likely to be equally disappointed with your wagering rules. Know yourself as you examine the various strategies we have collected from our readers, and whatever betting system you choose to give a try, be sure it is something that you will be able to consistently follow.
