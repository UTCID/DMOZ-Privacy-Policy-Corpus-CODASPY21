General Data Protection Regulation
For information on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how it may affect you, please visit our FAQ.
Identity of Data Controller. For the purposes of this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”), the “data controller” (i.e. the person responsible for the capture, storage and use of your personal information) is Rational Poker School Limited (“RPSL”), who can be contacted at Douglas Bay Complex, King Edward Road, Onchan, Isle of Man, IM3 1DZ or via email to Support. In this Privacy Policy, when we say “PokerStars”, “Full Tilt”, “we” or “us” we are referring to this company.  References to “Group” means RPSL together with its subsidiaries and any holding company of RPSL and any subsidiary of such holding company and any company associated with the group of companies known as The Stars Group.
Our Commitment to Our Players’ Privacy. We are the owner and operator of the websites located at www.pokerstars.net and www.fulltiltpoker.net (the “Sites”). We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the personal information collected by us, utilising ‘best in class’ information security technology and procedures, all in accordance with European Union standards of data protection.
Purpose of this Privacy Policy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to enable you to understand how we collect, store, use and safeguard your personal information and to explain your rights in relation to that information and its use.
Our Legal Obligations. We will comply with the terms of the Isle of Man’s Data Protection Act 2002 (as may be amended or updated from time to time) (the “Act”) when processing your personal information. Your personal information may be also processed or transferred by us to other members of our group of companies, our affiliates, our agents and third parties providing services to us, in jurisdictions outside of the Isle of Man and the European Economic Area. In this event we will comply with the terms of the Act which ensure that personal data is only transferred to such jurisdictions which comply with the various ‘adequacy’ requirements for data protection set out in the Act.
What do the Capitalised Terms Mean? Unless we give them a specific meaning in this Privacy Policy, capitalised terms shall have the meaning given to them in our End User Licence Agreement which takes precedence over any conflicting provision of this Privacy Policy.

Your Agreement to the Privacy Policy1. Agreement: By using the Service, you (“User” or “you”) agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as may be amended by us from time to time, save that we will ask you separately, when you provide us with your details whether you consent to receiving promotional communications from: (a) us; and also (b) third party providers of goods and services with whom we may share your details. Amendments: We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any amendment will come into effect immediately upon such change being notified on the Sites.

The name you register with us must be your own name. In addition, it is important that you complete the account details with valid information. You must advise us of any relevant changes to your personal information as provided to us and we do not accept liability for any harm that you may suffer as a result of you failing to notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us.

Should you close (or if we shut down) your Stars Account with us, we will retain your personal data for a period of 6 (six) years to allow us to meet our regulatory and legal obligations and defend ourselves against any claims. Personal information which is not needed for these purposes will be deleted after this period. Purposes: We, members of our Group of companies, our affiliates and third parties providing services to us or to you on our behalf will use your personal information for the purpose of conducting our business and providing the Service to you.
