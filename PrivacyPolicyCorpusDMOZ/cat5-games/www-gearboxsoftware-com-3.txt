BINDING ARBITRATION & CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS CONCERNING ANY DISPUTES REGARDING USE OF THE LICENSED WORKS BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY, ITS PARTNERS, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS.
(a) Dispute. As used in this Agreement, “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, demand, action, proceeding, or other controversy between you and the Company concerning the Online Services or Licensed Works, whether based in contract, warranty, tort (including, without limitation, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, concealment, omission, negligence, conversion, trespass, strict liability, and product liability), statute (including, without limitation, consumer protection and unfair competition statutes), regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis or theory. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.
(b) Informal Resolution Option. You and the Company agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute before commencing arbitration. Unless you and the Company otherwise agree in writing, the time for informal resolution will be 60 days from the date on which you or the Company mails a notice of the Dispute (“Notice of Dispute”) as specified in Paragraph(c). You and the Company agree that neither party will commence arbitration before the end of the 60-day period provided for informal resolution.
(c) Dispute Notices. Notice of any Dispute with the Company regarding online use of the Licensed Works must be sent via email to dispute@gearboxsoftware.com as well as by U.S. Mail to Gearbox Software, LLC, ATTN: LEGAL DEPT/ARBITRATION NOTICE, 5757 Main Street, Suite 500, Frisco, TX 75034, and must contain a written statement setting forth (1) your name, address, and contact information; (2) your email address; (3) all facts giving rise to the Dispute; and (4) the relief you seek. Notice of a Company Dispute with you will be sent to your registered email address and by U.S. Mail to the known mailing address.
(d) BINDING ARBITRATION. IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT IF YOU AND THE COMPANY DO NOT RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY INFORMAL NEGOTIATION UNDER PARAGRAPH (b) ABOVE, ANY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES IN PARAGRAPH (g) BELOW. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY OPTING TO USE THE LICENSED WORKS OR THE SITE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION WHICH FORFEITS ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. INSTEAD, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, WHOSE AWARD (DECISION) WILL BE BINDING AND FINAL, EXCEPT FOR A LIMITED RIGHT OF APPEAL UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. ANY COURT WITH JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES MAY ENFORCE THE ARBITRATOR’S AWARD.
THE ONLY DISPUTES NOT COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO NEGOTIATE INFORMALLY AND ARBITRATE ARE DISPUTES ENFORCING, PROTECTING, OR CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF ANY OF THE COMPANY’S (OR ANY OF YOUR OR THE COMPANY’S LICENSORS’) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
(e) Small Claims Option. Notwithstanding Paragraph (d), you may also have the right to litigate any Dispute regarding your use of the Licensed Works or the Site in small claims court, subject to satisfying all requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the disputed amount at issue.
(f) CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, IN COURT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT NEITHER YOU NOR COMPANY WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, A COLLECTIVE ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY PROCEEDING IN WHICH YOU OR THE COMPANY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND THE COMPANY FURTHER AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF YOU, THE COMPANY, AND ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING.  YOU AND THE COMPANY  AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO FASHION A PROCEEDING AS A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION OR TO AWARD RELIEF TO A GROUP OR CLASS OF USERS IN ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.
(g) Arbitration Procedure. Subject to the terms herein, the arbitration of any Dispute will be conducted by, and according to the rules and procedures of, the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). Information about the AAA, and how to commence arbitration before it, is available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA will govern the arbitration. If you are an individual consumer and use the Licensed Works for personal or household use, or if the value of the Dispute is $75,000 or less, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes of the AAA will also apply. If the AAA rules or procedures conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will govern. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules and procedures. Where the value of a Dispute is $10,000 or less, any hearing will be via electronic communications unless the arbitrator finds good cause to instead hold an in-person hearing.
(h) Arbitration Location. You agree to commence arbitration only in Collin County, Texas. The Company agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence.
(i) Costs & Fees. In any arbitration you commence, the Company reserves its right to seek its expenses associated with the arbitration process. In a Dispute involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing and AAA administrative fees and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. You and the Company agree that fees and expenses are not counted in determining how much a Dispute involves.
(j) Enforceability. If the class action waiver (which includes a waiver of private attorney-general actions) in Paragraph (f) is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, whether by judicial, legislative, or other action, then this Section and its subsections will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts of the Dispute will be severed and proceed in a Texas court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. The definition of “Dispute” in Paragraph (a) will still apply to this Agreement.
(k) Rejection Rights. If the Company makes a material change to this Section (other than an administrative change or revision to the notice address in Paragraph (c)) while you are authorized to use the Licensed Works or the Site, you may seek to reject the change by sending the Company written notice (in English, please) within 30 days of the basis for rejection by email to privacy@gearboxsoftware.com and via U.S. Mail to the address contained in Paragraph (c). You agree that you will informally negotiate and arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the most recent version of this Section prior to the change you rejected and that Company reserves all lawful rights irrespective of such rejection.
(l) Severability. If any provision of this Section and its subsections, other than Paragraph (f) (i.e., class action waiver), is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated only to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.
(m) Survival. The provisions of this Section will survive termination of this Agreement and the provision of the Online Services, Licensed Works and the Site.
TERMINATION
The Company may terminate or suspend your access to any and all Online Services and any registered account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Online Services will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Online Services or login into your account and click “Delete my account” option. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, limitations of liability and the like.
MISCELLANEOUS
In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall only be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, the Privacy Policy located at www.gearboxsoftware.com/privacy, and the Publisher’s End User License Agreement located on the game product, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and any and all written or oral agreements heretofore existing between you and the Company with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement are expressly canceled. The Company may modify the terms of this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion by posting a revised Agreement or, in the case of a material modification, by posting notice of such modification on the website page entitled “Terms of Service” or “Legal Notice” (or similar title).
