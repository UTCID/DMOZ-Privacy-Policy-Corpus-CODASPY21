Thanks for visiting the idaholottery.com website.
Our privacy policy is simple: we collect NO personal information (like names or addresses) when you visit our website. If you choose to provide that information to us, it is only used to fulfill your request for information or a service.
Privacy Policy:
This privacy policy details our commitment to safeguard your information, and the limited manner in which we will use and disclose the information you provide to us. By using our web site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information by us as set forth in this policy.

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, then you may contact us at info@idaholottery.com. For additional information about the use of our web site, please review the Idaho Lottery Web Site General Terms and Conditions of Use.
Key Terms:
Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. When we use the term “Personally Identifiable Information” in this privacy policy, we mean information that is specific to you as an individual, like your name, age, email address, telephone number and facsimile number. The term “User Information” incorporates all of your Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy. We use the term “aggregate” when we combine information from various persons or users. Information said to be “anonymized” if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.

When you visit our web site to browse, we may collect, use and store information such as the type of computer modem and Internet browser you are using, the number of times you visit our web site and the particular pages you view, the date and time you access our site, linking to and from our site, and the length of your visits to our site. We may share this information with third parties if we choose to aggregate and disclose site traffic information to improve the use of our site for our visitors. When visiting our web site, you may choose certain on-line options such as (i) to contact us, (ii) to send us a resume, (iii) to obtain lottery retailer locations where you may purchase our products or (iv) to receive information about our products or services (e.g., to request e-mail notification of daily winning lottery drawing results or to request information about becoming a lottery retailer). When you engage in any of the foregoing activities, you provide us certain Personally Identifiable Information. We collect and store this Personally Identifiable Information, any updates to such information that you send us, and any modifications that we make to such information. Except as set forth in this policy, we will not reveal any such Personally Identifiable Information to any other third party without your consent, except that we may share User Information with our business associates who assist us in administering our products or services. Furthermore, we may use, disclose or transfer certain User Information (a) to send you the information you request; (b) to send you newsletters and other information about our products or services; (c) to protect the confidentiality or security of your records; (d) to law enforcement or other government officials if appropriate for your protection or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of possible unlawful activity; (e) to our attorneys, accountants, or regulators; or (f) as may be required by applicable law. We may also use User Information that does not constitute Personally Identifiable Information in any manner that is not prohibited by law. In addition, we may also use and disclose any anonymized information that you send us such as your suggestions, ideas or other creative material without acknowledgement or compensation to you.
Public Disclosures:
In the State of Idaho, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by State government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public’s right to access public records that serve various needs: the privacy of individuals is included among these exceptions in both state and federal laws.
We strive to protect personally identifiable information by collecting only information necessary to deliver our services. All information collected at this site becomes a public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists.
In the event of a conflict between this idaholottery.com Privacy Notice and the Idaho Open Records Law, or other laws governing the disclosure of records, the Idaho Open Records Law or other applicable laws will control.
