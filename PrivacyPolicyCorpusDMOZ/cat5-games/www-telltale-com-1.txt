If the preceding sentence is not deemed to be enforceable, then this section will be considered void and extinguished. The arbitration shall take place exclusively in California and shall be governed by California law without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Parties may however seek interim relief, including (and without limitation) any injunctive or other equitable relief, from either the Court or arbitrator to protect against infringement of any intellectual property interests or if interim relief is otherwise deemed by a party to be proper. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a written decision regarding the arbitration and, upon request from either party, will provide a statement of reasons for the decision. The arbitrator must follow California law (and federal law if applicable), and any award may be challenged on that basis. Subject to applicable laws, either party may request a court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
