Cookies
An Internet user’s browser sets Cookies (when enabled) that contain small amounts of data on the Internet User’s computer after a visit to any Web site. Cookies are used to assist merchants in the tracking Internet users’ activities originating from an Affiliate’s Web site or e-mail. If the Internet user visits or revisits an advertiser’s site directly from such Affiliate, Income Access maintains the ability to continually track the Internet user’s activities on the Merchant’s site and reward the Affiliate that referred the Internet user. The Cookies do not intentionally reveal any personally identifiable information to Income Access or the Merchant about the Internet user.
Our collection and use of information from Merchants or Affiliates
Although Income Access requires Merchants and Affiliates to adhere to Good Business Practices as a condition of membership in the Income Access Network, Income Access is not responsible for the information practices of Merchants or Affiliates. Merchants and Affiliates may collect information from or about Internet users, including personal information. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by Merchants and Affiliates is subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from Income Access’s Privacy Policy. If an Affiliate has been given permission by the Internet user to record personally identifiable Internet user data (e.g. through special promotions) the anonymous Internet user data may be coded by an Affiliate to enable the Affiliate to generate personally identifiable Internet user data. Under the foregoing circumstances, the information remains anonymous to Income Access. In the event Income Access does receive and record partial email addresses of Internet users, only in circumstances where the Internet user has voluntarily provided his or her identity and contact information through the Merchant’s Web site or Affiliate’s Web site. In no way does this enable Income Access to personally identify an Internet user.

Restrictions on Disclosing Information to Parties outside Our Company
