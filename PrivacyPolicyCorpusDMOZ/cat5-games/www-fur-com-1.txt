About the Policies
The policies are nothing short of a contract that the user agrees to abide by. Failure to do so may lead to loss of privileges or even termination of your account. They can also be looked at as an Acceptable Use Policy, or just plain rules that guests of the system are expected to follow.
The purpose of the policies are to help provide a consensual, enjoyable experience on this system, by giving guidelines for what is considered socially acceptable behavior as well as defining the wizard's expectations of the users.
While the policies try to be reasonably comprehensive, we know we can not cover every possible situation. Therefore the wizards will try and uphold the spirit of these policies rather than the letter of them.
The next step is to look at Policy Mission Statement for an overview of what the muck is about.
From there you should read Policy Glossary for a list of terms used in these policies, and then see the index below for a list of what policies Tapestries MUCK has. You should be familiar with all of them.
If you have any questions or comments, please contact the wizards within the muck with the in game Request System. For alternalte methods of contact, please see Contacting Us.
Note: The policies were originally broken up to facilitate easy reading on the Muck. As such they are arranged in many small chunks. That may be fixed in the future now that they are exclusively web published.
