TERMS OF USE - Updated January 21, 2014
Welcome to CreatureBreeder.com (the “Site”). The Site is operated and presented to users by CreatureBreeder.com (“Creature Breeder”).
Creature Breeder may also be referred to herein as “we”, “us” or “our”.
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SITE. By using the Site or by clicking a box that states that you accept or agree to these terms, you signify your agreement to these terms of use and the Creature Breeder Rules. If you do not agree to these documents, you may not use the Site.
IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU PROVIDE YOUR CONSENT TO YOUR CHILD’S REGISTRATION WITH THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE IN RESPECT OF THEIR USE OF THE SITE.
Note that special terms apply to some services offered on the Site, like rules for particular contests or sweepstakes or other features or activities.
These terms are posted in connection with the applicable service.
Subject to applicable law, any such terms are in addition to these terms of use, and in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms of use.
You acknowledge that these terms of use are supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge that such consideration includes your use of the Site and receipt of data, materials and information available at or through the Site, the possibility of our use or display of your Solicited Submissions (as defined below in Section III, entitled “SUBMISSIONS”) and the possibility of the publicity and promotion from our use or display of your Solicited Submissions.
USE OF CONTENT
The Site is only for your personal use.
You may not use the Site for commercial purposes or in any way that is unlawful, or harms us or any other person or entity as determined in our sole discretion.
All information, materials, functions and other content (including Submissions) (“Content”) contained on the Site are our copyrighted property or the copyrighted property of our licensors or licensees.
All trademarks, slogans, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are proprietary to us and/or our licensors or licensees.
We may change the Site or delete Content or features at any time, in any way, for any reason.
Except as we specifically agree in writing, no Content from the Site may be used, reproduced, transmitted, distributed or otherwise exploited in any way other than as part of the Site, not even as part of a derivative work, except that where the Site is configured to enable the download of particular Content, you may download one copy of such Content to a single computer for your personal, noncommercial home use only, provided that you (a) keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices, (b) make no modifications to, and do not rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, copy (except to create a single copy for your own back-up purposes), or create any derivative works based on the Site or the Content, in whole or in part, and (c) do not use the Content in an unlawful manner or in a manner that suggests an association with any of our products, services or brands.
Using our Content for any other purpose, including but not limited to “re-mailing” or high-volume or automated use of the Site or using any of our Content on any other Web site or networked computer environment, is a violation of our copyright and other proprietary rights and is strictly prohibited.
In the event that we offer downloads of software on the Site and you download such software, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the “Software”) are licensed to you by us or third-party licensors for your limited, personal, noncommercial home use only.
We do not transfer title to the Software to you.
Except as permitted under applicable law, you may not distribute or otherwise exploit the Software or decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, adapt it, or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-readable form, except to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Use of the Site or any software, code, device or other mechanism that allows automated gameplay, expedited gameplay, or other manipulation of gameplay or game client will result in immediate termination of the Account.
Creature Breeder reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to determine what constitutes manipulation of gameplay or game client.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL HAVE THE EFFECT OF TRANSFERRING THE OWNERSHIP OF ANY COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, SLOGANS, SERVICE MARKS, TRADE NAMES, TRADE DRESS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE SITE OR CONTENT OR ANY PART THEREOF TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY NOR TO AUTHORIZE YOU TO CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS BASED ON THE CONTENT. You undertake not to do any act or thing which is inconsistent with or which is likely in any way to prejudice such title.
SUBMISSIONS
In these terms of use, we use the word “Submissions” to mean text, messages, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories, screenplays, treatments, formats, creatures, artwork, photographs, drawings, videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics), sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons’ names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions, appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material, and/or other similar materials that you submit, post, upload, embed, display, communicate or otherwise distribute (collectively, “Distribute”) on or through the Site.
There are two types of Submissions: Solicited Submissions and Unsolicited Submissions. “Solicited Submissions” means those Submissions (a) that we expressly request or enable you to provide to us via any feature or activity on the Site for our review or display and possible specifically-defined consideration or compensation (collectively, “Consideration”) (such as prizes or other value in games, sweepstakes, contests and promotions); and (b) that you Distribute on or through the Site for which you do not seek Consideration (such as in our Public Forums (as defined below in Section VI, entitled “PUBLIC FORUMS AND COMMUNICATION”)). “Unsolicited Submissions” are any and all Submissions that do not fall within subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph.
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS; NO IMPLIED CONTRACT.
Our company policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited Submissions so please do not Distribute Unsolicited Submissions on or through the Site.
We want to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by us or under our direction might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.
We therefore ask that you not Distribute any Unsolicited Submission.
In any event, you agree that any Submissions you make is not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type (other than any stated Consideration).
Except as expressly stated in these terms of use, the provisions of these terms of use apply equally to Unsolicited Submissions and Solicited Submissions.
Accordingly, we, our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users shall be entitled to exploit and disclose all Submissions, and we shall not be liable to you or to any person claiming through you for any exploitation or disclosure of any Submission.
LICENSES AND REPRESENTATIONS
You hereby grant us and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, a non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license for an indeterminate period (or for such maximum period permitted by applicable law) under all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual and industrial property rights you own or control to use, reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify, create derivative works based upon, perform and otherwise exploit such Submissions, in whole or in part, in all media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised for any and all purposes including, without limitation, entertainment, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you, with or without attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other person or entity (the “Submissions License”).
By communicating a Submission, you represent and warrant that the Submission and your communication thereof conform to the Rules of Conduct (set forth below in Section VII labeled “RULES OF CONDUCT”)) and other requirements of these terms of use and that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents and permissions, without the need for any permission from or payment to any other person or entity, to exploit, and to authorize us to exploit, such Submission in all manners contemplated by these terms of use (including the Submissions License). These terms of use (including the Submissions License) do not limit any past or future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers you may have made or make with respect to Submissions.
To the extent that any Submissions you Distribute on or through the Site contain original songs or recordings, you hereby represent that you are a member of the applicable mechanical, performing rights and/or copyright owners’ society and that all musical compositions (including lyrics) and sound recordings contained in such Submissions are available for licensing to us (and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users) directly from such societies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of whether you are a member of any rights society, you grant the Submissions License with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recordings contained in such Submissions.
To the extent that we solicit Submissions through features or activities on or through the Site (including games, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, and Public Forums) that require the use of our copyrighted works (in whole or in part), we hereby grant you a non-exclusive license to create a derivative work using our copyrighted works (in whole or in part) as required (but only as required, and only for the purpose of creating your Submissions); provided however, that such license shall be conditioned upon your assignment of all rights in the work you create to us.
If such rights are not assigned to us, your license to create derivative works using our copyrighted works (in whole or in part) shall be null and void.
You agree to the foregoing grant of rights, consents, agreements and assignments whether or not your Submissions are used by us.
You hereby appoint us as your agent with full power to enter into and execute any document and/or do any act which might be necessary to confirm the grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers set forth in these terms of use.
You agree that any Submissions you make are not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type.
To the extent any “moral rights”, “ancillary rights”, or similar rights (“Moral Rights”) in or to the Submissions exist and are not exclusively owned by us and to the extent you are able to do so under applicable law, you agree not to enforce any such rights as to us or our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, and you shall procure the same agreement not to enforce from any others who may possess such rights.
Without limiting the scope of the Submissions License or any future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments, and waivers you may make with respect to Submissions, and to the extent allowed by applicable law, you hereby ratify any prior grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers made by you with respect to Submissions submitted by you to us.
