Depositing Funds
You may deposit funds by logging in to your account, and following the steps for using any method that we have approved, including credit cards, debit cards, ACH transfer, and PayPal. We do not guarantee that each of these funding mechanisms will be available or that any particular card will be accepted. You will be required to provide certain financial account information in order to fund your account, including, but not limited to your social security number, bank account number, routing number, credit or debit card account information, or PayPal account information. The same credit or debit card may not be used to fund more than one account.
For ACH Transfers, you authorize Global Payments Gaming Services, Inc. (Global Payments) or its Service Providers to initiate debit and credit entries to the account at the depository financial institution for which you have provided information. By authorizing ACH Transfers, you also agree to be bound by the Terms of Use of Global Payments and any Service Providers which can be found here: https://www.vippreferred.com /en /terms-of-service
You agree to abide by all applicable terms and conditions required by your financial institution, financial service, or payment processor. You are solely responsible for any transaction fees or penalties of any kind imposed by any financial institution, payment processor, or other third party associated with processing your transaction. You are required to reimburse us for any losses we suffer as a result of any transaction fees, charge-backs, insufficient funds, or penalties of any kind associated with your transaction. You hereby authorize us to hold and collect any amount owed to us as a result of any such losses from your deposits or winnings. We reserve the right to pursue any other means to recover such losses.
At the discretion of the Lottery, players may be able to deposit funds into their account using one of two methods available through participating Lottery retailers, and known as “iGift” and “iFunds.” You must be a member of Fun Club and have an account in order to fund through an iGift or iFunds transaction.
In order to fund your account through an iGift transaction, you (or other purchaser 18 years of age or older) may request from a retailer an authorized amount (in whole dollars). After the retailer is paid, the retailer prints a voucher. You may then log in to your account, and follow the steps for redeeming your voucher or iGift. Subject to account balance and deposit limits, the amount will be added to your account. If the addition of an iGift would cause your account balance and deposit limits to be exceeded, the iGift cannot be added to your account. An iGift expires five (5) years after the date of purchase, and cannot be replaced, reused, reloaded, or exchanged for cash.
In order to fund your account through an iFunds transaction, you log in to your account, and follow the instructions for retrieving your “Player Identification Card,” which you will need to provide to a participating retailer. You may request iFunds of an authorized amount (in whole dollars), subject to your account balance and deposits limits, from the retailer, and present your Player Card for retailer to scan. The retailer scans your Player Card. The terminal will display the maximum amount that you can add, based on account balance and deposit limits. Retailer then enters the amount (equal to or less than the maximum allowed), and takes your payment. You will receive a receipt from the retailer and the amount will automatically be applied to your account.
By initiating a deposit, you represent and warrant that you:
understand that funds you deposit into your account may not be withdrawn or refunded, unless required by law;
have authority to use the payment source and method you select;
are not depositing funds derived from any fraudulent or unlawful source;
will not attempt to reverse, charge-back, block, cancel, or in any way attempt to prevent us from receiving the deposit;
consent to our sharing your personal information with any third parties that we use to process your requested deposit;
consent to us performing any background check or investigation we deem necessary to ensure that your payment source and method are authorized;
understand that you must be physically located within the boundaries of Kentucky in order to purchase lottery tickets through the website.
We are not required to examine your authority to use a payment source or method and are entitled to assume you have authority. We may require you to provide additional information, provide copies of documents, or appear in person at a designated claim center. We do not guarantee that a deposit will be processed and made available in any specific period of time. We do not guarantee that a deposit will be free from error. We reserve the right to deny any deposit at any time and without notice. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from any delay, denial, or error in processing a deposit.

Any changes to the deposit limits will be provided and available on the kylottery.com website and incorporated herein by reference. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from setting or changing any minimum or maximum deposit amount. You have the option of setting lower limits by logging in to your account and going to “My Limits.” If you set lower limits, you will be required to wait 24 hours before raising your limits, and you may never exceed the limits set by the Lottery.
No Withdrawal or Transfer of Deposit
Funds you deposit into your account cannot be withdrawn, returned, charged-back, re-credited, or transferred to another account, unless required by law. It is your responsibility to refrain from depositing more than you will use. You agree that you will not attempt to deny, reverse, charge-back, re-credit, block or otherwise attempt to invalidate, recover, or deny us receipt of a deposit. You hereby authorize us to hold and collect any amount owed to us as a result of any such losses from your deposits or winnings. We reserve the right to pursue any other means to recover such losses.
Maximum and Minimum Deposit and Prize Winnings Account Balances
You may have no more than $2,000 in funds deposited by you in your account, and you may have no more than $5,000 in prize winnings in your account. We reserve the right to change these maximum limits, or to set or change a minimum required amount for all funds in your account, at any time and without notice. Any changes to these limits will be provided and available on the kylottery.com website and incorporated herein by reference.

The only evidence of a ticket purchase or outcome is the data contained in our system that passes all security tests, including, but not limited to, verification against third-party systems and transaction history.
If an iLottery Instant Game play is not played out to completion for any reason, including the interruption of the player, loss of connectivity during game play or game termination by the Lottery, the player will be notified by email that the game has not been completed and that the game will be available for a specified time. If the play is not completed within that time, play will be completed automatically by the system on the player’s behalf to reveal the outcome determined at the point of purchase. The player will be notified by email of such outcome, and the prize claim and payment process remains the same, whether player plays the game to completion or the game is completed automatically.
In questions involving ticket validation, or a dispute between the Kentucky Lottery and player as to whether a prize has been won or paid, the determination of the Kentucky Lottery’s’ President is final. In cases of dispute for any reason, the President may at his or her sole discretion, replace the disputed ticket with a ticket of equal value or refund the purchase price. The President’s decision to replace or refund a ticket is the purchaser’s exclusive remedy.

tickets winning a free play may be redeemed only through online purchases;
prizes of $600 or less are automatically deposited into your account, subject to the prize winnings account limit of $5,000.

The Kentucky Lottery Corporation reserves the right in its sole discretion to increase the total cash prize values that may be claimed online, or at cashing agents. Players can contact the Kentucky Lottery headquarters or a Lottery Retailer for current cashing limits.
Before payment of any prize, we may require you to provide additional information, provide copies of documents, or appear in person at a designated claim center. We may change available methods for claiming a prize at any time and without notice. If we suspect any unlawful conduct or violation of these terms, we may withhold payment of a prize pending completion of an investigation. You agree to cooperate with us in any investigation. We do not guarantee payment of a prize within any specific period of time. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from any delay in payment of a prize.
Process for Claiming Prizes over $600 and up to $49,999.99
If you have won a prize over $600 and up to $49,999.99, you must log in to your account and follow the directions for indicating whether you want to: (1) claim the prize online and have your check mailed to the address on file for your account; or (2) claim the prize in person.
Online Claim Process for Prizes over $600 and up to $49,999.99
If you choose to complete the online claim process, you will be required to provide your Social Security Number and must indicate whether you are a U.S. citizen. By providing this information, you represent and warrant that: you are the registered user of your Fun Club account; your account information is accurate; and you accept our claim policy. You further represent and warrant that you have truthfully represented whether or not you are a U.S. citizen, you have provided us with your correct social security number; are not subject to backup withholding; and are not subject to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). We will pay your prize by issuing a check, unless the prize is an annuitized prize. A check will be mailed to the address on file for your account.
Claiming in Person
If you are claiming a prize in person, you will be required to provide a valid government issued photograph identification, such as a driver’s license, or other form of photograph identification acceptable to the Kentucky Lottery, and a completed claim form, which requires you to provide your Social Security Number and to indicate whether you are a U.S. citizen.

We will pay your prize by issuing a check, unless the prize is an annuitized prize.
Backup Withholding
Backup withholding refers to the process by which a person or entity making payments to you must, under certain conditions, withhold and pay a percentage of such payments to the IRS. Your prize will be subject to backup withholding if you do not provide your correct social security number to us, you do not certify your social security number when required, the IRS notifies us that you furnished an incorrect social security number, the IRS notifies you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all of your interest and dividends on your tax return, or you do not certify to us that you are not subject to backup withholding. For more information, please visit the IRS website at www.irs.gov.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The FATCA requires US taxpayers to report certain foreign financial accounts and offshore assets. It also requires certain foreign financial institutions to report all US account holders that are specified US persons. To learn if you own foreign financial assets subject to the FATCA or if you qualify for an exemption from the FATCA, please refer to the IRS website at www.irs.gov. Withholding is the cost of not reporting.
Tax Obligations
A lottery prize is considered income and a taxable event when claimed or received. We report all prizes over $600 to the IRS and Kentucky Department of Revenue. A Form W-2G is generated for all prizes over $600, and will be mailed to you with your check if you claimed online or provided to you in person if you claimed in person. We are required to withhold state and federal tax from all prizes over $5,000. These withholdings are estimates only and do not necessarily satisfy the tax liability. It is your responsibility to immediately inform us if you believe there is an error in reporting or withholding. You are solely responsible for properly reporting and paying your applicable local, state, and federal taxes. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your failure to properly report or pay any local, state, or federal taxes.
State Debt Check and Set Off
Before paying any prize of over $600, state law requires us to check for certain debts, including back taxes owed to the state, child support arrearages, and student loan debts, or to provide information to state agencies for their administrative purposes. If any such debts exist, we are required to offset your prize by the amount of the debt. If you believe that prize money was withheld for a debt that has already been paid, it is your responsibility to contact the agency reporting the debt and seek reimbursement. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from any offset from a prize for payment of a debt or for providing information to state agencies in accordance with state or federal law.
Claim Errors
A lottery claim may not be premised on human or electronic error in the communication, display, or transmission of data regardless of how that data is recorded, displayed, or transmitted. A claim may not be premised on any intentional human, electronic, or other form of communication or transmission that was not authorized by the Kentucky Lottery. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from any erroneous or unauthorized communication, display, or transmission of data.
Time for Claiming a Prize
If you have a winning ticket from a draw game, you must claim the prize within one hundred eighty (180) days after the drawing in which the prize was won. If you win after playing a game in which you may determine instantly whether you have won or lost, including an Instant Play game, you must claim the prize within one hundred eighty (180) days after the end of the game as announced by the Lottery. KRS 154A.110(2) (e). Game end dates are announced on the website kylottery.com.
Failure to Claim a Prize
If a valid claim is not made for a prize within the required time period, the prize shall constitute an unclaimed prize and will be addressed as provided in KRS 154A.110 (3). It is your responsibility to properly claim your prize. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your failure to properly claim your prize.
IX. WITHDRAWING PRIZE WINNINGS

LIGHTNING KENO PICK 1-10
KENTUCKY LOTTERY CORPORATION
iLOTTERY INSTANT PLAY GAME RULES
“LIGHTNING KENO PICK 1-10” – $1.00
REVEAL I.D. NO. 3550
VERSION 2.2 – EFFECTIVE DATE 3/31/16
By purchasing any iLottery Instant Play Ticket and accessing any Instant Play Game, a player accepts and agrees to comply with the iLottery Terms of Use, the applicable game rules and all other applicable rules and procedures. If you do not agree, do not access or purchase any game.
1.
DEFINITIONS
A. iLottery Instant Play Game or Instant Play Game means an electronic KLC instant game, and is available only through the KLC’s Website. Instant Play Games are not games sold by Lottery retailers.
B. iLottery Instant Ticket or Instant Play Ticket means an electronic or virtual KLC instant win ticket or play, and is purchased only through the KLC’s Website.
C. Lottery or KLC means the Kentucky Lottery Corporation with headquarters located at 1011 West Main Street, Louisville, KY 40202.
D. President means the President of the Kentucky Lottery Corporation or any other person to whom the President's authority is lawfully delegated.
E. Website means the KLC’s website at kylottery.com, includes the websites of the KLC’s agents, contractors, subcontractors, and third parties involved in producing or delivering the Website and related services, and also includes any mobile device application or any other applications that KLC may publish in connection with these services.
2.
INSTANT PLAY TICKET PRICE
An Instant Play Ticket for this Instant Play Game may be purchased for $1.00, unless authorized by the President at a discount for promotional purposes.
3.
HOW TO PURCHASE
A. Instant Play Tickets are only available online and may not be purchased at retail. In order to purchase an iLottery Instant Play Ticket, a player must be a member of the Lottery’s Fun Club Rewards, must log in to his or her Fun Club Rewards account at http://www.kylottery.com, and successfully complete the purchase process according to the iLottery Terms of Use.
B. To purchase an Instant Play Ticket, the player must be at least 18 years of age, have a valid Kentucky address, be physically located within the Commonwealth of Kentucky at the time of the purchase, have a properly registered account, and be using player’s own account to purchase a ticket. The KLC may deem invalid any purchases made in violation of these requirements, the iLottery Terms of Use, or other applicable rules, and may refuse to award the prize.
C. All sales are final. Once the purchase is completed, the player may not cancel the purchase. The player is solely responsible for ensuring that he or she has selected the correct lottery game and all options relating to that game, including, but not limited to, game ticket, number of tickets, and price of tickets. Purchases made in error will not be refunded.
D. Player is solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment and connectivity necessary to access the Website and purchase an Instant Play Ticket. Games may not be available on certain devices due to operating requirements associated with the Games. The Lottery makes no representations or warranties as to a player’s ability to access, purchase, and play any game, or that the Website or games will display correctly on all devices on which they can be viewed.
E. Players may have the option to "Buy Now" or "Try Now." By design, the Game play and player experience are the same, although there are important differences. By choosing "Buy Now," the player elects to purchase the Instant Play Ticket, and the purchase value will be deducted from the player's account. Once confirmed, Instant Play Ticket purchases cannot be voided or cancelled. If a Game player chooses "Try Now," the player acknowledges that he or she is playing a trial version of the Instant Play Game; the player is not purchasing an Instant Play Ticket, and the player will not be awarded a cash prize even though the Game results may reveal a prize.
4. HOW TO PLAY
The object of Lightning Keno is to match revealed keno board numbers.
To begin play, the player must select the number of spots he or she wishes to play, and complete the purchase process set out in the iLottery Terms of Use. The outcome of the player’s ticket is determined at the time of the ticket purchase. At the start of the game, Lightning Keno presents the player with a game-play window, displaying the following: a question mark (How to Play) button; a keno board with numbers ranging from one (1) to eighty; QUICK PICK and CLEAR buttons; and TICKET COST, BALANCE, SPOTS, and WINS boxes.
The player selects the keno board numbers according to the number of spots selected, or clicks QUICK PICK, so a PLAY button appears. The player’s selection of numbers has no bearing on the outcome. To begin play, the player clicks PLAY, which causes the PLAY button to become a launcher, and the game launches twenty keno balls.
If a keno ball lands on a keno board number that matches a player’s pick, the game highlights the matched number and notes the match in the space above the launcher. If keno balls land on keno board numbers that match the number of picks required to win, the game highlights the matched numbers and notes the matches and prize value in the space above the launcher.
To complete play, the game must reveal twenty keno numbers. The game then displays a message indicating the game’s outcome, the total prize value in the WINS box, and an arrow (Back) button, which the player clicks to exit the game.
5.
DETERMINATION OF PRIZE WINNERS
A. iLottery Instant Play Games are games of chance, and the outcome of a play in the case of any Game is determined by the system at the point of purchase and is not affected by the skill, judgment or action of the player. The system distributes outcomes based on the probabilities within the prize structure. The overall chances of winning in a Game at each prize level are determined by the prize structure. Outcome will not be affected by a disconnection from the system after point of purchase.
B. The revealing of the play symbols on the Instant Play Ticket does not determine if the Instant Play Ticket is a winning Ticket. The revealing of the play symbols is for entertainment purposes only.
C. A player who validly purchases an iLottery Instant Play Ticket using his or her Fun Club Rewards account, and according to these rules and the iLottery Terms of Use, is the owner of the iLottery Instant Play Ticket, is entitled to any prize won on that ticket, subject to all requirements necessary to claim the prize. An iLottery Instant Play Ticket is a NOT bearer instrument. Neither the electronic record of purchase, nor any other confirmation of the purchase is a bearer instrument. An iLottery Instant Play Ticket may not be assigned or transferred, except as allowed or required by law.
D. If an iLottery Instant Game play is not played out to completion for any reason, including the interruption of the player, loss of connectivity during game play or Game termination by the Lottery, the player will be notified by email that the Game has not been completed and that the Game will be available for a specified time. If the play is not completed within that time, play will be completed automatically by the system on the player’s behalf to reveal the outcome determined at the point of purchase. The player will be notified by email of such outcome, and the prize claim and payment process remains the same, whether player plays the game to completion or the game is completed automatically.
