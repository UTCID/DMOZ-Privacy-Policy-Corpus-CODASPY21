Here at Slitherine we do not use any intrusive DRM. This is very popular with our audience but means we have no way to validate your games after you have purchased and there is no way for us to remove games from your machine, even if we wanted to. This means that we operate a no returns policy on digital downloads. All sales are final.
If you are buying a boxed game, you will immediately receive a download link. Simultaneously the factory automatically puts your order in the production queue. All games are manufactured on demand and are personalised with your name, order ID and serial number. The serial number matches the one you received for your digital download. As these items are personalised they cannot be returned and all sales are final.
