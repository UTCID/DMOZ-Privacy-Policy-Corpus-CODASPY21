What Information is this web site gathering about its visitors and how is it being used?
Every computer connected to the Web is provided with a domain name (e.g. someispname.com) and an IP Address (e.g. 192.164.13.145). When a visitor requests a page from within this web site, our Web Servers automatically identify and log the HTTP request that is made to our Web Server. By itself, this information reveals nothing personal about you. The information that we usually gather and create a log of is as follows:
• The IP Address of the Site that may have Referred you.
• Your IP Address
• The Web Page that you may have linked to us from if any.
• The Product Identifier for Version and Make of Browser (e.g. Web Explorer®)
• The Operating System platform that you may be running (e.g. Macintosh® or Windows®)
• Search Words or Terms that are passed from a Search Engine (e.g. Google® or Yahoo!®)
• Information readily available and stored in your Adobe® Flash System.Capabilities Object.
There is absolutely nothing special about the information just described, and the practice of collecting this data has been generally standardized by most Web Servers and sites on the Web today.
The purpose of this information is actually two-fold. One, this web site has found it advantageous to examine visitor traffic in its aggregate, so that we can ensure maximum support and compatibility for the various Browsers and Operating Systems that visit our site. Additionally, as any business should attest, it is our desire to generate greater amounts of visitor traffic. By analyzing visitation patterns, referring URLs and Search Engine terms, we can strategically enhance our exposure on the Web.

Typically, by accessing the browser’s help feature you can obtain information on how to prevent your browser from accepting all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience on our web site and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended. We generally give notice when cookies are required.
What other information does this web site request?
We may request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey, adding you to our mailing list, or by your request to have someone contact you for additional information. Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict, No Spam or UCE, a policy which means we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.

Depending upon the method of payment that you select and your location, the required information may vary. However, generally speaking, we will need specific information to protectively process such transactions. We generally use features that safeguard this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypted servers.
