I'll keep this simple:You can equip materia on both your weapon and armguard, where 2 slots are connected you can combine a magic materia (such as fire) with an effect materia (such as "all") in this example it would allow you to cast fire on all enemies during battle. Late in the game you will find more materia that can be combined with any command, not just magic, of partuicular note is "deathcounter" which causes you to use the linked skill when you die, combined with a phoenix summon (life to all allies, damage to enemies) it makes you almost invincible in battle.The 2 places you can equip materia represent your weapon and your armguard, in most cases(late game especially) stronger equipment has fewer slots, no linked slots, or has the "growth: none" mod, meaning materia in that equipment will not gain ap.The growth mod is really the only reason you would place materia in 1 piece of equipment over the other, for example you can get a bangle really early on (sorry long time since I pkayed so can't remember where, but I think it's a sword for cloud) that has "growth: double" meaning the materia in it gains double ap from battles, materia in the other equipment doesn't gain ap. The "Check" option just allows you to see your currently equipped materia without going intot he equip screen.The "Arrange" option lets you move materia around without having to equip and unequip it.8 years ago

You know the basic functions. The triangle button brings up the menu. Directional buttons move the cursor, like this.Select each menu by using the OK button.If you want to leave the menu, just push the CANCEL button.See? Let's go ahead.Now you're in this menu, Select [Materia] sub menu.Select who you want to use it. Now look at the weapon there.Each weapon and armor has slots in it.Choose which slot you want to put Materia in.Then select the Materia you want to use.An example of materia is Curative Materia.If you want to know what the effect is, like the cursor up with [Check] and push the OK button.It's just like selecting battle commands.Just line the cursor up to [Magic], you can see that the available magic has increased.Now you can use new magic [___].And that's some basics for you.8 years ago
