Emergency's Randolph Mantooth At Fire-Rescue Med
I headed out again this year to Las Vegas for Fire-Rescue Med.
I attended last year and found it well worth the trip.
I really wanted to go again this year so I made sure I put in my training request early. I recommend EMS Personnel and Narcotics Tampering: Awareness and Prevention, interesting stuff.
I saw Randolph Mantooth at the conference last year and am looking forward to seeing him again.
Below is a nice interview with the actor by ems1.com about the conference.

Firefighter Photo Site
I wanted to let everyone know about a new photo site I am working on.
I was trying to think of a really great way for firefighters to share their pictures.
I am not super high tech yet so I am working on a blog and pulling pictures from across the web that I really like.
The new website I am working on is called firefighterphotos.com .
I thought is was a great name and also found a pretty good looking blog template.
Right now I am pulling in photos from across the web that allow sharing (creative commons) and posting them.
The only problem is that most of the photo sites do not have any stories that relate to the photos.
I would really like to be able to get some great stories to also post.
If anyone is looking to share some pictures or looking to get some backlinks for their fire blog or department page, send me a line.
If you have some picture that you are the owner of just email me
and I will post and hook you up with a link on my page to your site.
Right now I only woul
