Privacy policy
SPIL Games BV (hereafter referred to as "SPIL"), is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our users and handling any personal date we obtain from our users with care and respect. An overall principle is that we do not collect more information than is reasonably necessary to provide you with the best user experience.
This privacy policy (hereafter referred to as the "Privacy Policy") is applicable where SPIL acts as a data controller with respect to your data. This is the case where we determine the purposes and means of the data processing on our websites, which includes certain games and other activities that are offered by us on or through our websites. Our websites, all the web pages that are part of the websites, and such games and activities are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Websites."
SPIL GAMES BV, having its registered office at Mussenstraat 15, 1223 RB, Hilversum, the Netherlands (hereafter referred to as "SPIL"), may use affiliates' or reputable third parties' services for the processing of personal data collected on or through the Websites. By using or accessing our Websites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
1. About Our Websites
1.1 Our Websites offer a diverse, and exciting mix of online games created by SPIL, as well as games created by independent developers and SPIL partners. Players can access our Websites to play games without registering; however, they may choose to register to create a public or private profile and to save games, high scores, and comments on this profile. Also, visitors to the Websites will be able to rate games and browse for the newly added, top-rated, and most-popular games. The Websites may include automated decision making in the form of behavioral advertising.
1.2 Certain games on our Websites are controlled by third parties, including third parties located outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). SPIL’s own hosting facilities for the Websites are located within the EEA. SPIL uses commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any data processing that takes place on the Websites is in line with the applicable data protection laws. Privacy safeguards we take are contractual safeguards with third parties and the employment of technical privacy solutions, such as monitoring and blocking tools. However, as we do not control all games, data may be collected and transferred of which we are not aware. If you have concerns about data processing in a game, please send an e-mail to info@spilgames.com stating your concerns and the URL of the games.

The transaction data may include your personal details, your payment card details, and the transaction details. Whenever you buy something from the Websites (e.g., a virtual game item), the information that you provide to the PSP is subject to their privacy policies, not ours. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract. You explicitly consent that SPIL may provide personal information collected from you to a PSP for the purpose of the offering of the payment-transaction service whenever you buy something from the Website(s) and that such PSP may use such data for (statistical) analysis of payment transactions.
