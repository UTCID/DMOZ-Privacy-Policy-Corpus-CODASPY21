Harmonix collects information, including personal data, directly from Users, automatically via use of the Services, and in some cases, from third parties. The information that Harmonix collects about Users (which may be combined across Services and features) varies depending upon the particular Services used, and may involve the following:
A. Registration. To the extent we offer user registration on the Services, to register as a member of any of the Services, you may be required to provide us certain information that is identified on the registration page. Depending upon the Service, this may include your name, a user name and password, and other information, such as your country of residence, email, contact information and date of birth. Additional information may be requested during the registration process (but not required). Certain Services will not be available if you decline to provide the required information.
B. Information from Third Party Accounts. You may be able to connect certain third-party accounts (each a “Third Party Account”) – such as Xbox Live, PlayStation®Network, Facebook, etc. – to your use of the Services, so that, among other things, you can connect with your friends and network and share game information. In addition to linking a Third Party Account, we also may allow you to login to certain Services through certain third party accounts, including Facebook http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ (each a “Third Party Account”). If you choose to login this way, you are asked to share certain information with us (which may include name, email, friends and public profile information); the specific information and whether it is required or optional is stated on the permissions page when you login with the Third Party Account.

In an effort to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all Users, we may employ "anti-cheating" software or applications during the use of certain Services to prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may negatively affect the experiences of a User. When creating a profile for certain Services, we may collect data about your personal computer in order to create a hash of machine components.

4. HOW WE MAY SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
Harmonix may disclose your information, including personal data, as follows:
Service Providers and Processors.

In providing their services, they may access, receive, maintain or otherwise process personal data on our behalf. Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of your personal data for their own marketing and other purposes.
Affiliates. We may also share your information with our affiliate companies for purposes of assisting us to operate and market our Services. Our affiliate companies are subject to this Privacy Policy when they use your information.
Legally Required. We may also disclose your information if we believe we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; when we believe necessary or appropriate to disclose personal data to law enforcement or other governmental or regulatory authorities or the courts (in any relevant jurisdiction worldwide), such as to investigate actual or suspected fraud or violations of law, breaches of security, or breaches of this Privacy Policy; to respond to any claims against us; and, to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Harmonix, our customers, or the public.

With Consent. We may also disclose your information to any other affiliated or third parties where you have consented or requested that we do so. For example, if you win a contest or sweepstakes, we may disclose the names of winners online, and we may also share your information with third party partners and co-sponsors, where relevant; in such cases, we will clearly notify you of the sharing, and you will have the choice not to participate or to otherwise object to such sharing. Where required by applicable law, we will publish information online or in the local press and to relevant regulators identifying the winner(s) of a context or sweepstake regardless of whether or not you consent to the same.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, we may share aggregate or de-identified information with third parties for research, marketing, analytics and other purposes, provided such information does not identify a particular individual and the individual cannot be re-identified.
5. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION
We collect some information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form or when you talk with our customer experience team. We and third parties also use certain technologies described below to collect information.
We and our third-party providers may use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your browsing activities, gaming performance and use of the Services. We may combine this “activity information” with other personal data we collect about you. Generally, we may use this activity information to understand how our Services are used, track bugs and errors, provide and improve our Services, establish matchmaking, verify account credentials, allow logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and protect our Services, as well as for targeted marketing and advertising, to personalize content and for analytics purposes.
Below, is a summary of some of the activities we may engage in. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our Cookie Policy below.
Log Files. We may collect certain activity information from log files. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile application to our servers when you access our Services. We may record certain information from these log files, including web requests, IP address, browser type and version, language information, referring and exiting URLs, links clicked, pages viewed and other similar information.
Cookies. Cookies are small files with a unique identifier that may be transferred to your browser through our websites. They allow us to remember Users who are logged in, to understand how Users navigate through and use our Services, to display personalized content and targeted ads (including on third party sites and applications).
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and web beacons. These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies that we may use to track the online movements of Users of our Services and to personalize content. We may also use these in our emails to let us know when they have been opened or forwarded, so we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications.
Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies. We may use “anti-cheating” and fraud prevention tools or applications, which may collect information about your browser, device and activities within the Services, to detect and prevent fraud and cheating.
Analytics Tools. We may use internal and third-party analytics tools to collect and aggregate activity data and other data across multiple channels. Third party analytics services integrated into our Services may combine the information they collect in connection with EA's services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
6. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING
We may work with third party ad networks, channel partners, measurement services and others (“third party ad companies”) to display advertising on our Services, and to manage our advertising on third party sites, mobile applications and online services. We and these third party ad companies may use cookies, pixels tags, and other tools to collect activity information on our Services (as well as on third party sites and services), as well as IP address, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers, general location information, and, with your consent, your device’s geolocation information; we and these third party ad companies use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content and to evaluate the success of such ads and content.
For example, we may work with Facebook (see their privacy policy at http://www.facebook.com/policy.php, and ad preferences page http://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads) to display targeted ads to you in Facebook. We may also work with others, such as Google Ads and DoubleClick (see their privacy policy at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy and ad preferences page at http://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated?hl=en), to display ads to you on other third- party sites, based on your use of our Services, activity information, and other interactions with us.
Custom Audiences and Matching. Unless you have opted out, we may share certain information (such as your email address) with third parties – such as Facebook and Google – so that we can better target ads and content to our Users, and others with similar interests, within their services. These third parties use the personal data we provide to help us target ads and to enforce their terms, but we do not permit them to use or share this data with other third-party advertisers. You can opt-out of our sharing your personal information to target you this way by emailing us at [email protected] If you opt out, we will process your opt out in a reasonable amount of time.
As noted above, you may control how Google, Facebook and other third parties display certain ads to you, as explained further in their respective privacy policies and ad preferences pages. You can also obtain more information about targeted advertising, and how to opt-out of receiving targeted ads from many third-party ad networks (including Facebook and Google), through the following:

7. DO-NOT-TRACK REQUESTS
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.

These features are hosted by the respective third-party operator even though they appear on our Services, and the third party may collect your IP address, URL, date and time stamp, browser details and the like, subject to their own privacy policies.
9. COMMUNICATIONS CHOICES
If you agree we may send direct marketing communications to you about our Services, events and promotions, we may also send you surveys, news, updates and other communications via email.

If you opt out of direct marketing communications, we may to the extent permitted by applicable law, still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.
In some of our mobile Services, with your consent, we may send push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about the game, events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
