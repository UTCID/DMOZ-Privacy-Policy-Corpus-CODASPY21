Privacy Policy
This document sets forth the Privacy Policy for PT Entertainment for our PubTriv game app and our websites www.pubtriv.com.au and www.quizmasters.com.au.
The goal we have here at PT Entertainment with our products is to provide you with a variety of fun challenges through trivia. You privacy is very important to us. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact us here.
Your Information
Our free PubTriv app allows you to compete with other players within the venue of your choice, and with other players in venues throughout Australia. Our free QuizMasters trivia game is designed for competition between individuals in any location. In both cases, we require little personal information except what is needed to allow the game to operate and for you to be identified as a potential prize winner. That is a name, user (screen) name email address and phone number. As we collect no money, and prizes are collected by competition winners at their local venues, no further information is required.
We respect your privacy and will endeavour to ensure your privacy is maintained when providing information electronically. To avoid the risk of another person accessing your account, please don't share your password with others.
For each visitor to reach the site, we expressively collect the following non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the Site, page access times and referring website address. This collected information is used solely internally for the purpose of gauging visitor traffic, trends and delivering personalized content to you while you are at this Site.
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use for these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the policy change forward will adhere to our updated practices.
We will not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to any outside party personally identifiable information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.
We train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. Access to your Personal Information is restricted to employees who need it to provide benefits or services to you.
