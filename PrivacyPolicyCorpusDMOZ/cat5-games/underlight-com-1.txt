8. Rules of Engagement
All users are subject to the following Rules of Engagement. Failure to follow these
rules may result in suspension or termination of the user’s access to KoiWare, LLC services.
The First Rule – Be Honest with the Software
Cheating or hacking of any kind is prohibited. Because the client software is
a terminal to our servers, using an altered version of the client software is an
attempt to hack our servers. This is a federal offense, and violators will be prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law. The use of any program that alters data transferred
between our server and the client will also be considered an attempt to gain unauthorized
access to our servers and will also be prosecuted. Using any game mechanics to gain
a technical advantage is considered cheating and is subject to disciplinary action.
The Second Rule – Respect Others
a) Keep your behavior appropriate at all times. If your language or behavior repeatedly
annoys or offends others, you will be banned from playing. We place no limits on
the use of language. Consenting adults are free to engage in any language or behavior
they mutually agree to, however, much of the player-base are young role-players,
and should not be subject to some adult language. Inappropriate behavior includes
attacking other players without a valid in game reason, using unnecessarily offensive
language, annoying others with out of character chat, excessive begging, etc.
b) Distasteful language whether in-character to in-character, out-of-character to
out-of-character, out-of-character to in-character, or in-character to out-of-character
will not be tolerated on official KoiWare, LLC servers or channels. The game staff retains
the right to determine what behavior is deemed inappropriate and will go through
thorough and specific procedures to implement penalties. Penalties may include a
verbal warning, temporary suspension, or in severe cases, termination/banning.
The Third Rule – Stay in Character
Underlight is a true Roleplaying game. Upon entering the realm of the City, you
have to always remember you are pretending to be your character and leave the outside
life of the real world behind. Your character would have no way of knowing sports
scores or the latest in music or fashion. So, to protect the environment that all
role players are striving for, leave the real world chat outside please. If you
must communicate real world things, please do so in whispers and put the information
in double quotes. For example: John Doe whispers: ((hey how do I bind a key to my
art?)). This way you can be sure to not offend anyone and protect the active role
playing that is going on around your character. —- These rules are a very simple
guideline to your behavior when playing Underlight. Use your best judgement and
behave as if you were in a room full of random people of all ages. The game staff
retains the right to determine what behavior is deemed inappropriate and will go
through a thorough and specific procedure to implement penalties. Penalties may
include a verbal warning, temporary suspension, or in severe cases, termination/banning.
7. User Created Content
The user grants KoiWare, LLC express consent to communicate User Content to third parties,
including, but not limited to, social media outlets, gaming websites, and other
medias for the use of promoting any KoiWare, LLC services.
KoiWare, LLC will not attempt to generate revenue from User Content without the prior
approval of the user.
