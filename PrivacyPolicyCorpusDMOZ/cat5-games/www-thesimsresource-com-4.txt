Any such unauthorized use may also violate applicable laws, including without limitation copyright and trademark laws and applicable communications regulations and statutes. Unless explicitly stated herein, nothing in these Site Terms may be construed as conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise. This license is revocable at any time.

Hyperlinks
The Site may contain links to third-party Web sites ("Third-Party Sites") and third-party content ("Third-Party Content") as a service to those interested in this information. You use links to Third-Party Sites, and any Third-Party Content therein, at your own risk. The Sims Resource does not monitor or have any control over, and makes no claim or representation regarding, Third-Party Content or Third-Party Sites. The Sims Resource provides these links only as a convenience, and a link to a Third-Party Site or Third-Party Content does not imply The Sims Resource's endorsement, adoption or sponsorship of, or affiliation with, such Third-Party Site or Third-Party Content. The Sims Resource accepts no responsibility for reviewing changes or updates to, or the quality, content, policies, nature or reliability of, Third-Party Content, Third-Party Sites, or Web sites linking to the Site. When you leave the Site, our terms and policies no longer govern.

The Site may contain discussion forums, chat rooms, comments, guestbooks, review services or other forums in which you or third parties may post reviews of content, messages, materials or other items on the Site ("Interactive Areas"). If The Sims Resource provides such Interactive Areas, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk. By using any Interactive Areas, you expressly agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Site any of the following:
Any message, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, graphics, code or other material ("Content") that is unlawful, libellous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable;
Content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law, including, without limitation, the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any rules of a securities exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ;

Viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files;
Content that is unrelated to the topic of the Interactive Area(s) in which such Content is posted; or
Content that, in the sole judgment of The Sims Resource, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Interactive Areas or the Site, or which may expose The Sims Resource or its affiliates or its users to any harm or liability of any type.
The Sims Resource takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Content posted, stored or uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss or damage thereto, nor is The Sims Resource liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity you may encounter.

Although The Sims Resource has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, The Sims Resource reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Site at any time and for any reason, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or store on the Site at your sole cost and expense.
Any use of the Interactive Areas or other portions of the Site in violation of the foregoing violates these Site Terms and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Site. In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas or court orders, to protect The Sims Resource's systems and customers, or to ensure the integrity and operation of The Sims Resource's business and systems, The Sims Resource may access and disclose any information it considers necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, user profile information (i.e. name, email address, etc.), IP addressing and traffic information, usage history, and posted Content. The Sims Resource's right to disclose any such information shall govern over any terms of The Sims Resource's Privacy Policy.
