Halo 3's release on PC has helped The Master Chief Collection's player population on Steam surge.Steam's own publicly available data shows that The Master Chief Collection reached a peak concurrent player base of 54,761 people on launch day, July 14. With numbers that big, MCC moved inside of the Top 10 list for the most-played games on Steam's entire platform.Halo 3 and MCC are also available to buy on PC directly from Microsoft's Store, while Xbox Game Pass members on PC can get the games, too. As such, the total player count for Halo 3 and MCC overall is surely much higher.MCC and Halo 3 are also tracking well on the Top-Sellers charts for Steam, with MCC and Halo 3 ranking as the No. 2 and No. 3 best-sellers on Steam right now, only behind another new release, Death Stranding.Halo 3 is available to buy as an individual game for $10 USD or through MCC for $40 USD. MCC on PC currently includes Halo: Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, and Halo 3. ODST and Halo 4 will follow later on to complete the package.To celebrate the release of Halo 3 on PC, 22 developers from 343 Industries shared their stories about how the game changed their lives. The next brand-new Halo game is Halo Infinite, which sees the return of the evil Banished enemies. Microsoft will show off Halo Infinite's campaign during an event on July 23, so it won't be much longer until we learn more about the next-generation Halo game.
