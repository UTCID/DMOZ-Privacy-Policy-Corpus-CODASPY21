operates compmike19.com and may operate other websites. It
is Comp Mike 19's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Comp Mike 19 collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Comp Mike 19's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how Comp Mike 19's visitors use its website. From time to
time, Comp Mike 19 may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Comp Mike 19 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on compmike19.com
blogs/sites. Comp Mike 19 only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.

depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at compmike19.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Comp Mike 19 are asked to
