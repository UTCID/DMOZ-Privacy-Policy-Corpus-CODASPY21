If your product is shown to be "in stock" on our website when you place your order, the number of days between the order date and the date that the carrier first attempts to deliver to the given address can be calculated as follows:1. Dispatch time (24-48 hours) = payment validation + order preparation + parcel collection by carrier2. Delivery time of your parcel(s) according to the carrier you have chosen. Carrier delivery times start from the moment you receive an e-mail confirming order dispatch.Dispatch and delivery times are given in working days.
An Grupa Edman Teo offers several methods of delivery.
7. Lost parcels
An Grupa Edman Teo does everything in its power to respect the delivery times indicated on the website. We cannot, however, be held responsible for the consequences of a late delivery or the loss of a package caused by a third-party contracted to make delivery, or by you, or because of some unforeseen event or an Act of God. In the event where you do not receive your package in the indicated time frame, an investigation will be conducted with the carrier.
We use following carriers:
www.anpost.ie
www.dpd.ie
www.tnt.com
If you have paid for tracked delivery, just key in the tracking number given to you by email on the above websites.  Tracking will be available appr. 12hours after shipping.
The most common shipping problems are:
Postman called and there was nobody at home.  Check with the local post office if it is stored there. The postman is supposed to give you a notice but quite often forgets to do that.
Postman delivered next door.  Check next door.
Postman delivers to the wrong address and the packet has to be brought back to the local post office and go out again. This can take a few days.
Tracking number not coming up on a search.  Sometimes the post office scanner misses the tracking info and normally the packet will be delivered within estimated time. Do not panic. Also sometimes our dispatchers enters in the wrong number and you cannot get a tracking.  It is rare but it does happen.
Tracking ends in London.  The post office tracking system has problems in transferring from one system to the other.  Normally parcel will arrive on estimated time.
As a rule of thumb we do not consider a package lost for European destinations until after 30days and worldwide 60 days.  It is our experience that 99.9% of parcels will turn up within this time period. No reimbursement or re-delivery will take place during this period.
Upon reception of your order, we recommend that you verify your products against the order that you placed with us and if necessary, write any anomalies that may have occurred on the delivery voucher, not forgetting to sign it.
