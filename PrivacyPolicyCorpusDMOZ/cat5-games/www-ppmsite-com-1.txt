Why We Collect Data and What We Collect
We collect data for various reasons, such as:
a) To provide you with services and information. We may collect data which are required to provide you with the content of the Project Perfect Mod Website. Our cookies temporarily stores the IDs of the forum topics that were visited in the current session, time of the last visit and IP. For Project Perfect Mod Registered Visitors, our database may also collect the data you voluntarily provide at the moment you sign up with a new account in the forums or change your profile data, your posts and private posts in the forum, your request to be notified by replies into topics or your participation of the surveys. Some Project Perfect Mod Downloadable Software may also access our servers for checking for updates when requested by the user or in the first install, to download the required files. We may use third-party service providers, acting as data processors, to assist us in provisioning additional content to you or in our operations, such as videos from YouTube or 3D models from Sketchfab. In this case, these and any other third-party service providers may act as separate data controllers, who provide products and services complementary to our services. Further data processing performed by these service providers is governed by their privacy policies. The legal basis for this data processing is performance of contract between you and us.
b) To protect us from unlawful use of our server or services. We may collect data which are required to protect us from any unlawful, unauthorized use of our services, or which are necessary to ensure security of our services, including both data provided by you (see above) and data collected in the course of use of the Project Perfect Mod Website. We may use third-party service providers, acting as data processors, to assist us in preventing the third party software to post unauthorized advertisement on our forums, prevent the creation of PPM Accounts by bots and to prevent non-humans from downloading huge files from our servers. Currently, we are using Google ReCaptcha, which may use cookies and collect data from Project Perfect Mod Non-Registered Visitors to ensure that the visitor is a human being according to their privacy policy. The legal basis for this data processing is Project Perfect Mod's legitimate interest in protection from unlawful and insecure use of Project Perfect Mod services.
c) For internal use of analytics and statistics about the usage of Project Perfect Mod Website.
