WebChess Privacy Policy
Our basic policy is that we don't care who you are, but we keep track
of what you do with our machines, and you will be responsible for
anything you ask us to publish on your behalf.
Forms
This web site makes a reasonable effort to refrain from disclosing
information submitted via forms.
We cannot guarantee that accidents
won't happen.
If you are concerned about privacy and are unwilling to
take the risk, simply do not provide your information.
Private
information is never a requirement for services provided here.
Browsing
The mere act of viewing pages on this site will not cause private
information about you to be recorded.
We do, however, record your IP
address, the date and time your browse each page, and the URL of the
page.
We normally do not make this information available to the
public - it is collected to provide statistical information about
server usage, and to plan for future capacity.
We may occasionally
use "cookies" to temporarily identify your session in order to improve
the quality of service we provide, but such cookie use will not cause
any personal information about you to be disclosed to us.
