We maintain physical, electronic
and organizational safeguards to protect this information.
We require any person or
organization providing products or services to customers on our behalf to protect
the confidentiality of this information.
We afford former customers
the same protections as existing customers with respect to the use and sharing
of their information.
We permit only authorized
employees, who are trained in the proper handling of this information, to have
access to it.
