Introduction
Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using these websites.
For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, "you" and "your" means each person, group of individuals, entity or entities who visits the Illinois Lottery's websites, which include www.illinoislottery.com, https://m.myillinoislottery.com and www.myillinoislottery.com (collectively, the "Lottery Websites") or the Illinois Lottery's ticket purchase mobile app ("Mobile App") for any purpose (the Mobile App and the Lottery Websites collectively, the "Websites" or the "Website").
Thank you for downloading the Mobile App and/or visiting the Lottery Websites.
In these Terms and Conditions, the "Website Providers" or "we" means the Illinois Department of the Lottery, including its agents, contractors, and any parties involved in creating, producing, or delivering these Websites or providing information related to the Websites, including, but not limited to, Camelot Illinois LLC ("Camelot Illinois") and each of their respective successors and assigns.
The purchase of Illinois Lottery game tickets for Lotto, Mega Millions®, Powerball®, and any other Illinois Lottery game tickets authorized by Illinois law to be sold over the internet ("Internet Tickets") or subscription plans ("Lottery Subscriptions") on these Websites is strictly limited to persons who are at least 18 years old and who are located within the geographical boundaries of the State of Illinois at the time of purchase of the Internet Tickets or the Lottery Subscriptions. You must be 18 years or older to download the Mobile App. As an authorized, registered player, you may access your Illinois Lottery account ("Players Account") from outside the State of Illinois. However, you must be located within the geographical boundaries of the State of Illinois to purchase Internet Tickets or Lottery Subscriptions. In order to comply with legal requirements governing the sale of Internet Tickets and Lottery Subscriptions, precise information about your location or the location of your device will be collected. The Website Providers uses geo-filtering software ("Player Location Service") and the Mobile Device Geo-Location Service ("Device Geo-Location Service") (for mobile device users) to verify that you and your device are located in the state of Illinois when you make a purchase. If the Website Providers are unable to verify that you and your device are located in the state of Illinois, you will not be able to purchase Internet Tickets or Lottery Subscriptions. Upon successful verification of your location and the location of your device, you will be able to utilize these Websites to purchase Internet Tickets (provided you are in Illinois at the time you purchase the Internet Tickets); sign-up for and purchase Lottery Subscriptions (provided you are in Illinois at the time you purchase the Lottery Subscriptions); log into your Players Account; view transactional history, account balance, winning Illinois Lottery numbers, or otherwise manage your Players Account; and access other information related to the Illinois Lottery. Note that if your mobile device is turned off, the Player Location Service or the Device Geo-Location Service will not detect your location or the location of your device. Additionally, mobile device users who opt out of allowing the Device Geo-Location Service to detect the location of their device will not be allowed to purchase Internet Tickets or Lottery Subscriptions. Access to and use of your Players Account is strictly limited to you as the registered and authorized user. Accordingly, you should not share your username and password with anyone. Prior to making a purchase, you must check a box, certifying that you (1) are the registered and authorized user of your Players Account, (2) are at least 18 years old, and (3) are completing a purchase from a location within the geographical boundaries of the State of Illinois. Failure to comply with any of these requirements will result in forfeiture of all winnings.
The Website Providers reserve the right to terminate, suspend, or cancel any Players Accounts for suspected fraud of any type, any attempt to purchase Internet Tickets and/or Lottery Subscriptions from a location that is not within the geographic boundaries of Illinois, the purchase or attempted purchase of Internet Tickets and/or Lottery Subscriptions by persons under the age of 18 years old, and for violations of any applicable rules, regulations, or state or federal laws.
In the event a purchase is determined to have been placed by an individual under the age of 18 by someone other than the registered owner of the Players Account, from a location outside the State of Illinois, or through any fraudulent or unlawful means, the prize will be forfeited, the funds deposited into the Lottery Fund, and the Players Account may be cancelled.
The Illinois Lottery encourages parents to ensure that children under the age of 18 do not have access to Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") that may be used to set up a Players Account and/or purchase Internet Tickets or Lottery Subscriptions on the Websites.
For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, PII means information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. In this case, PII includes, among other information, an individual's name, address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail, account number, password information, and any other information used to identify you on the Websites. A domain name or Internet protocol address is not considered PII. PII does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.
These Terms and Conditions are a binding legal agreement between you and the Website Providers. By visiting a Website, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with these Terms and Conditions, you should immediately stop using any Website.
If you browse through any Website and review information, such as game rules or winning numbers, then only Sections I through II of these Terms and Conditions apply to you. If you sign up for or access a Players Account, which is required to purchase Internet Tickets or sign up for Lottery Subscriptions, then the entire document applies to you.

The Website Providers will cooperate fully with any law enforcement officials and/or agencies if requested or required in the investigation of any users who violate these Terms and Conditions and may disclose your information to such law enforcement officials and/or agencies if required by law.
Making Purchases
A. About Players Accounts
You must sign-up for a Players Account in order to purchase Internet Tickets or Lottery Subscriptions. If you are listed on the Illinois Lottery's Voluntary Self Exclusion Program database, you will not be allowed to set up a Players Account. The amounts of Internet Tickets per day you are permitted to purchase is subject to limitations established by the Illinois Lottery. At any time, you may maintain only one (1) Players Account.
When you open a Players Account, you are authorizing the Website Providers to deposit your winnings of $600 or below per wager into your Player Account. If the balance in your Players Account exceeds $2000 at any given time, for the Website Providers will automatically transfer amounts in excess of $2000 via an Automated Clearing House ("ACH") transaction or issue a check payable to you for such amounts. You may use winnings on deposit in your Players Account to purchase Internet Tickets and Lottery Subscriptions but no other products. Any winnings in your Players Account may be transferred out to your bank account through an ACH transaction, or you may request a check for the balance. All winnings over $600 will be verified by the Website Providers, and you will be required to complete an Illinois Lottery Claim Form to receive your winnings.
The funds in your Players Account will be held separate from the funds of the Illinois Lottery, Camelot Illinois (manager of the Illinois Lottery) and its subcontractors. No Website Provider will use your funds for operating expenses or for any purposes other than the payment of winnings. Funds in the Players Account will be combined with the funds of other holders of Players Accounts and placed into pooled accounts with one or more FDIC-insured banks ("Pooled Accounts"). These Pooled Accounts will be held in the name of Camelot Illinois for the benefit of the holders of Players Accounts. Balances in U.S. Dollars that are held in Pooled Accounts may be eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance. In the unlikely event that an FDIC-insured bank that holds your funds fails, the total of all of your balances would be subject to the FDIC pass-through deposit insurance coverage. For purposes of calculating your total balance, the bank would take into account the balance in your Players Account plus amounts on deposit in all of your other qualifying accounts at the bank. Pass-through deposit coverage is contingent upon Camelot Illinois or its contractors maintaining accurate records and on determinations of the FDIC as receiver at the time of a future receivership of any bank at which your funds are placed.
Any funds in the Players Account are subject to the Abandoned Property provisions described in Section V. E. of these Terms and Conditions.
B. Players Account Information
Any information you provide in setting up your Players Account is subject to the Illinois Lotterys Privacy Notice. You are responsible for keeping your Players Account login username and password secret and confidential. If you fail to do so, you are responsible for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities, and losses that you or the Website Providers may incur as a result. If you discover fraudulent or unauthorized purchases or funds transfers or suspect that your Players Account is being used by an unauthorized third party, you must notify the Illinois Lottery immediately by calling 1-800-252-1775. Providing prompt notice to the Illinois Lottery will help limit your liability for such fraudulent or unauthorized transactions. You certify that any information provided to the Website Providers in the registration form is complete and accurate. The Website Providers, in their sole discretion, reserve the right to require you to change your Players Account login username and/or password, if the Website Provider deems that your login information is offensive, inappropriate, or otherwise unacceptable.
The official record of all purchases and winning numbers will be maintained by the Illinois Lottery.
