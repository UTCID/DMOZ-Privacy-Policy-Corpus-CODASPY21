Share this page
BSAC takes its safeguarding duty very seriously regarding the safety and well-being of all those participating in the activities of snorkelling and diving.
The British Sub Aqua Club (BSAC) is committed to creating and maintaining a safe and positive environment to safeguard any adults at risk involved in the sports of diving and snorkelling in accordance with UK legislation.
The BSAC Adult Safeguarding Policy and Procedures apply to all individuals involved in the BSAC. This policy and procedures document outlines what safeguarding adults at risk is and what to do if you have a concern.
BSAC acknowledges that it is required to fulfil our duty of care, which means that we must do everything that can be reasonably expected of us to help safeguard and protect people from harm, and to act when we suspect that someone is being harmed, or is at risk of harm.
We want all who participate in our sports to find it fun and enjoyable. All adults have the right to be treated equally, and we aim to ensure that this always happens (see other BSAC policies covering equality, diversity etc.) We all have the responsibility to protect adults from any harm. This policy sets out how we as an organisation seek to protect the safety of adults at risk. It is expected that every member will have an awareness of this policy and that all diving and snorkelling Clubs will follow the policy and its guidance. If you have any doubts or queries in regards to the application of the policy you should contact the BSAC Safeguarding Officer at BSAC HQ.Download BSAC Safeguarding policyGo to child safeguarding
