While we have no obligation to monitor Contributed Content, we expressly reserve the right to edit or to remove any Contributed Content we deem to be inappropriate for any reason.
Amendments and Corrections to ContentWe do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness or reliability of information appearing on the Site. The Site may contain errors and omissions relating to product description, pricing and availability. We reserve the right to correct or update errors or omissions and to change information at our discretion without prior notice. We also reserve the right to cancel an order for a product in the event of an error or omission in the description of such product, including incorrect pricing information, whether due to a typographical error, an error in information received from our suppliers, or otherwise. By using the Site, you agree to hold us harmless from any claims relating to errors or omission on our Site.
Ordering on scoutshop.orgWe accept orders from anywhere in world.
Shipping within the United States includes APO/FPO addresses and Puerto Rico. Items may be shipped by a variety of carriers, generally of your choosing when you place your order.
When shipping to International Addresses there is the likelihood that your packages will be subject to customs fees and import duties of the country to which you have your packages shipped. You may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance are your responsibility; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, when ordering, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods. Customs forms for all international packages list the value of your order's contents.
The risk of loss and title for all items ordered on scoutshop.org passes to you when scoutshop.org delivers the merchandise to the shipping carrier.
The amount of tax charged to an order will be calculated based on the shipment destination's state and local sales-tax laws.
Our current payment procedures are American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa. We reserve the right to change our billing and payment procedures at any time by posting the new procedures on the Site.
We ship the items your order as they are available. We make every effort to send all items together, though we cannot guarantee it. Please note that we may send your items in separate boxes and from different destinations. However, this will not affect your shipping charges.
While we do our best to ship your order within 3-business days of of receipt, we cannot guarantee that all orders or all items in an order will ship within 3-business days of your order receipt due to inventory fluctuations. In such cases, we will notify you when items are out of stock or on backorder. You will also be notified as back ordered items are shipped.
Because we begin processing your order almost immediately after you place it, is difficult to change or cancel an order once you submit it.
Special OffersAny special offers related to Site, whether or not related to purchases on the Site, are subject to the particular terms and conditions (including time limitations) of such offers. Unless otherwise specified, you may use only one special offer in connection with a transaction.

We retain ownership of your account and license it to you on a limited, nonexclusive basis for the duration of your account activation.

You must not disclose your password to anyone except persons whom you have authorized to use your account, and you assume all resulting liability from use of the Site for such authorized person(s).

Limitation of LiabilityIn no event will we, our suppliers, service providers, councils, or other third parties affiliated with us be liable for any indirect, incidental, extraordinary, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages whatsoever (including without limitation those resulting from lost profits, lost data or business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the site or related services, the results of such services, or any information contained on the site, or in such services, whether such damages are based on warranty, contract, tort or other any other legal theory and whether or not such party is advised of the possibility of such damagers.

Applicable law may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
