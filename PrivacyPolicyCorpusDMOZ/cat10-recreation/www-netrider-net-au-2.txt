New Users to the Site
You can become a Premium Member of Netrider by going to the Account Upgrades section of Your Account.
What Benefits do Premium Members get?
Advertising removal - an ad-free experience when using the site. No general banner advertising is shown to premium members
Premium Member's forum - access to a private forum for Premium Members to hang out
Premium Member ribbon - a ribbon under your user post info displayed on each and every post
How do I know when my premium membership expiry date is?
Visit your Account Upgrades page to see when your current Premium Membership upgrade expires.
Will I be notified when my membership is about to expire?
Yes. For non-recurring membership, 7 days prior to expiry you will receive both an alert and an email (to your account email address) letting you know that your premium membership is about to expire, and directing you to the Account Upgrades page to renew.
Can I gift Premium Membership to another member?
Yes! Just visit the Account Upgrades page, and choose the Gift option/button. You'll be required to enter the recipients username, and also have an optional tickbox to select if you would like to gift it anonymously. The recipient will receive an alert when a membership has been gifted. At this time, only the non-recurring premium membership option can be gifted.
