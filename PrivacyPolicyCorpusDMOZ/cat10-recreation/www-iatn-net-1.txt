Terms of Use Revision 2.4.1 (April 6, 2018)
All services we provide are subject to our Terms of Use (this document),
Privacy Policy, Member
Agreement, and Usage Guidelines
(henceforth collectively referred to as "Usage Documents"). If you do
not agree with the conditions outlined in these Usage Documents, do not
proceed to use any service, information, or other products offered by
or through the International Automotive Technicians Network (henceforth
referred to as "this network" or "iATN").
By entering, using, viewing, or requesting any information or resource
provided from or through iATN and/or by registering a membership with
iATN, you understand and agree to be bound by the terms detailed in these
Usage Documents. You also understand that these Usage Documents may be
updated by us from time-to-time, without notice to you. It is your responsibility
to review the most current version of each Usage Document, including this
one.
Contact
Information. You may contact us at any time using the information
below. Please note that all correspondence with iATN is governed by our
Privacy Policy.
iATN700 N. 5th StreetMinneapolis, MN 55401
Phone: (866) 428-6428
Email:
Privacy. Your privacy while using this network is governed by
our Privacy Policy.
Guidelines. Members of iATN are also regulated by our guidelines
and member agreement.
Email
We Send. Members of iATN agree to receive email from iATN, including:
technical automotive help requests from other members and periodic messages
from iATN staff, including commercial emails advertising our network resources
(such as occasional notices to non-sponsors about our sponsorship options,
or notices when an industry sponsor has joined iATN). Members may turn
off the technical automotive email through our account configuration area.
Members may cancel their accounts if they wish to stop receiving all email
from iATN. We have a clear privacy
policy to protect our member's private personal information, such
as their email address. If you are interested in reading about our anti-spam
stance and our double opt-in procedure for new member registrations, please
read this.
False
SPAM Reports. As stated above, members of iATN agree to receive certain
email from us as part of their membership on our network. It is very easy
to configure your account to receive less email, and to cancel your account
if you wish to stop receiving all iATN email. However, some members choose
to falsely report our email as SPAM, either to their ISPs or the anti-SPAM
organizations like SpamCop. In the event that a member falsely reports
our email to them as SPAM, their account will be permanently deactivated,
and they will not be permitted to reactivate it, nor will they ever be
allowed to create a new account on iATN.
Interactive Content.
Any information submitted by members
to the "interactive" portions of our network is considered to be Interactive
Content (henceforth "Content"). Examples of Content include,
but are not limited to, forum posts, chat room discussions, TechHelp,
files uploaded to this network, comments on other members' Content, etc.
You retain all ownership rights to the Content you submit to this network.
However, by submitting this Content, you grant iATN a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce,
modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute,
and display such Content throughout the world in any medium. You grant
iATN and sublicensees the right to use the name, city, state, country,
and zipcode that you submit in connection with such Content, if they choose.
You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the
rights to the Content that you submit; that the Content is accurate; that
use of the Content does not violate this agreement and will not cause
injury to any person or entity; that the Content is not unlawful, harmful,
threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene,
libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically
or otherwise objectionable; and that you will indemnify iATN for all claims
resulting from Content you supply.
iATN has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor and edit or remove
any activity or Content. iATN takes no responsibility and assumes no liability
for any Content posted by you or any third party.
Message Visibility. iATN employs various technological features that can result in some member messages not being visible to all members, based on a variety of factors including: membership status, rating history, member preferences, and more. Posting a message to iATN does not guarantee that your message will be visible (or remain visible) to all or any members.
Network Access. iATN grants you a limited license to access and
make personal use of this network and not to download (other than page
cache) or modify it, or any portion of it, except with our express written
consent. You may not use any automated process (software program, machine,
etc.) to retrieve information from this network for the purposes of permanent
storage on your computer, nor for use to circumvent viewing the information
directly on this network. iATN's online resources are intended to be used only on an as-needed basis, viewed through our website, and may not be intentionally stored elsewhere. Members of iATN may not share their username
or password with anyone. All access to this network's systems is completely
monitored. For more information on this, please refer to our Privacy
Policy.
Premium Account Rate and Policy Changes. iATN may occasionally make changes to our pricing structure or other premium membership policies. Premium subscribers will be notified of major changes by email at least 30 days prior, providing time to cancel sponsorships should a sponsor not agree with a policy or rate change. For this reason, it is very important to make sure the email address on file with iATN is correct, and is accepting our email
(i.e. not blocking our messages due to email filters).
Resale or Re-Use Of Service. No portion of this network (including,
but not limited to, Interactive Content) may be reproduced, duplicated,
copied, sold, resold, or otherwise exploited for any purpose without express
written consent of iATN. You may not use any meta tags or any other "hidden
text" utilizing iATN's name or trademarks without the express written
consent of iATN. Any unauthorized use terminates the permission or license
granted by iATN.
Duplicate Accounts. Each person may have no more than one account
opened with iATN at a time. We reserve the right to cancel duplicate accounts,
at our discretion. Attempting to establish, and use, more than one account
at a time may result in the termination of all accounts registered in
that name. In addition, accounts cannot be registered to companies, they
must be registered to individual people.
False Identities. Any attempt to access this network using a false
identity, or to establish a membership account under false pretense, constitutes
unauthorized access to our computer systems without our permission, and
is prohibited under California Penal Code § 502.
Endorsement. Reference herein to any specific commercial products,
process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise,
does not necessarily constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation,
or favoring by iATN.
Soliciting. Members of iATN may not promote themselves or their
products in any area of this network, except where explicitly stated otherwise
(e.g., sponsor web pages, Classifieds Forum, etc.). Members may not solicit
sales for or promote the products, services, or work of any entity with
which they hold a personal or business relationship.
Advertisers, Sponsors, and Affiliates. You may encounter, throughout
this network, various advertisements by paid advertisers, sponsors, and
affiliates of the network. You agree that iATN shall not be responsible
or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of
any dealings with, or as the result of the presence of, such advertisers,
sponsors or affiliates on this network.
Discontinuance of Service. iATN reserves the right at any time
to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the services or
information provided by this network with or without notice. You agree
that iATN shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification,
suspension or discontinuance of the services or information provided by
this network.
Unsolicited Commercial Email ("SPAM"). You may not use
iATN's web site or this network for the purpose of sending unsolicited
commercial email (a.k.a. spam) to our members, or for the purpose of collecting
email addresses to spam. Using any list of email addresses that contains
a substantial number of iATN member addresses is considered a violation
of this agreement, regardless of whether you compiled the list yourself
or obtained it elsewhere. We reserve the right to immediately terminate
any member account suspected of spamming, or preparing to spam, our members.
This determination is normally made through complaints received from members
and/or security monitoring done within our network.
Termination. You agree that iATN, in its sole discretion, may
terminate your membership and/or sponsorship account (or any part thereof)
or use of this network, and remove and discard any Content within this
network, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use
or if iATN believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with
the letter or spirit of the Terms of Use. You agree that any termination
of your access to this network under any provision of this Terms Of Use
may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that iATN
may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information
and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files
and this network. Further, you agree that iATN shall not be liable to
you or any third-party for any termination of your access to this network.
