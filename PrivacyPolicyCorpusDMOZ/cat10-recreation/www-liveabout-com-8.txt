Once you have entered into the classic car world, you may find a language being spoken that is full of jargon and not readily intelligible to outsiders, and it can almost be described as a code or classification that embraces all aspects of classic cars.
Did you know the French used to refer to a convertible as a cabriolet or that the word Classic itself defines cares made between 1925 and 1942, according to the Classic Car Club of America or that doors that open vertically instead of horizontally are known as Gullwing doors?
Discover these definitions and more in the following list of the most common verbiage you'll need to know in order to understand and communicate properly in this very close community, from what generally counts as an antique classic car (before 1917), to the meaning of the slang word Woody.
