PayLease: The payments facilitation company that provides a payment solution and acts as a limited agent of the Merchant for the limited purpose of receiving, holding and settling payments to the Merchant.
Principal Payment: The payment You are making to the Merchant for an obligation You owe to the Merchant (for example, for rent, lease charges, homeowner association dues, a security deposit, an application fee, or other payment obligation). The Principal Payment is an amount You are paying the Merchant and is separate from any Service Fees paid to PayLease.
Service Fees: The fees charged by PayLease for providing the value added PayLease Payments-as-a-Service payment solution as described in detail below. Service Fees are separate from the amount of the Principal Payment and are for services, which are provided by PayLease on behalf of Merchant that are separate from the services provided to You by the Merchant directly. Service Fees are not surcharges.
Description of PayLease Services:PayLease provides online, phone, mobile and “walk-in” payment solution services. The services provided by PayLease on behalf of the Merchant to facilitate Your payment of Principal Payment obligations to the Merchant are different than, and separate from, the services provided to You by the Merchant directly. You acknowledge and understand that PayLease acts as the limited agent of the Merchant for the purpose of accepting payments from You on behalf of the Merchant. PayLease is not the retailer, seller, lessor, property management company or homeowner association. You further acknowledge and agree that PayLease is not a party to any lease, contract, or other agreement between You and the Merchant. PayLease does not have control of, or liability for, the services that are provided by the Merchant. PayLease may provide services through third-party service providers of PayLease. If the Merchant terminates its agreement with PayLease You will no longer be able to use the Services.
You may have the option to make a Principal Payment to a Merchant with an electronic check from Your bank account (Automated Clearing House, ACH, or e-check), with a payment card (credit card, debit card or other approved payment card), through PayPal, and/or via cash at a third-party agent location, or as otherwise determined by the Merchant. The Merchant can choose to offer You options for one-time payments and/or automatic recurring payments. PayLease will facilitate Your transaction according to the information You provide on the date You authorize PayLease to process the transaction. The Principal Payment will be credited to the Merchant, and any applicable Service Fees credited to PayLease. If You choose to receive a separate email notification of Your payment and You provide Your email, PayLease will send You an e-mail confirmation of Your payment as well as providing notification to the Merchant.
Registration and Use:In consideration of Your use of the PayLease Services, You agree that: (i) the personal information provided to PayLease is complete and accurate and in the event this information should change, You will update Your information in a timely manner to be complete, true and accurate; (ii) You are the user of the PayLease account and that You will not use the PayLease services for any illegal purposes; (iii) You are at least 18 years old and a resident of the United States; (iv) You will comply with all applicable federal, state, local laws, rules and regulations regarding Your use of the PayLease Services and system; (v) You are fully responsible for all activity occurring under Your username and password via Your PayLease account and in the event You have knowledge of unauthorized access to Your PayLease account, You will immediately notify PayLease at: http://support.paylease.com; and (vi) You are fully authorized to use any bank account, payment card or PayPal account, as applicable, registered in Your PayLease account.
You authorize PayLease, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries it considers necessary to validate Your identity. PayLease also has the right to ask to see identifying documents at any time such as Your driver license and other documentation.
Fees:PayLease charges You a Service Fee for Your use of the PayLease Service in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and PayLease’s agreement with Your Merchant. The Service Fees are charged for the services provided to You including providing additional payment channels (such as Internet, telephone, walk-in payment locations) and the services involved in facilitating payment of Your Principal Payment on behalf of the Merchant. The PayLease Payment Services are different than, and separate from, the services provided to You directly by the Merchant and for which You are making a Principal Payment(s), (e.g. lease payment, homeowner association dues, security deposit, application fee, etc).
While the PayLease system displays all related Service Fees in a visible location for You, You will receive a final confirmation page with the transaction amount including the Service Fee and will be given the opportunity to either “Submit” or “Cancel” the transaction. In the event that Your bank returns Your payment for Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF), You authorize PayLease to assess and process an automatic $25.00 NSF Fee to the same account from which Your payment was initiated. In the event that the NSF fee charged by PayLease is returned and/or generates additional fees assessed by Your bank, You assume all responsibility for such fees.
Transaction Authorizations:You hereby authorize PayLease to debit Your account, including the Principal Amount owed to the Merchant and Service Fees for PayLease Services, from Your bank account (ACH) or charge Your payment card or charge Your PayPal account on behalf of the Merchant for any of the transactions You submit. You agree that Your submission of a transaction constitutes Your authorization to PayLease to debit Your account, or charge Your card or PayPal account, based on the information You have provided. In the event You would like to request a refund for a transaction processed on the PayLease system, You must contact PayLease directly and adhere to the guidelines outlined in section 6 below for “Transaction Refunds.”
When Your Funds Are Paid:Payer acknowledges and agrees that subject to banking and card association rules and regulations, upon payment to PayLease by You for payment due to the Merchant, such payment obligation to the Merchant is considered paid and extinguished.  Payment is deemed made by You at the time at which PayLease receives the funds (as agent of the Merchant). In the event that any payment received by PayLease is not delivered to the Merchant as described in these Terms, the Merchant will have recourse only against PayLease in connection with the payment.
Transaction Refunds:You can request a refund through PayLease for a payment processed through Your PayLease account if the payment is still processing to the Merchant and not yet settled to the Merchant account. Once the funds have settled to the Merchant’s deposit account, You must request a refund directly through the Merchant.
All transaction cancellations or refunds through PayLease must be requested by logging into Your PayLease account and clicking on “Help” and then clicking on the “Contact Support” button. The request must include the transaction number and amount to be refunded. If You do not have login credentials – registered e-mail address and password – the refund request must be submitted to the Merchant for processing. Refund requests through PayLease are fulfilled only during PayLease business hours Monday through Friday 7:00 AM-5:00 PM Pacific Time.
Recurring Payments:
Fixed AutoPay: For accounts that have been set up with the fixed recurring payment option (“Fixed AutoPay”), PayLease will debit Your designated account for the authorized amount of the principal payment and PayLease Service Fee on the designated day each month until the Fixed AutoPay is cancelled. PayLease reserves the right to increase its Service Fee for Fixed AutoPay transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, however the fee will appear on the payment authorization page for You to see prior to Your approval of payment.
Variable AutoPay: For accounts that have been set up with the variable automatic recurring payment option (“Variable AutoPay”), the PayLease Service Fee may change based on the principal amount of the transaction.
