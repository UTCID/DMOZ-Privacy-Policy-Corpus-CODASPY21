Like most web servers on the Internet, information is collected for statistical purposes to create summary statistics (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.
When you send us personal identifying information via email (that is, in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form that emails us this information), we use it to respond to your requests. We may forward your email to other Fish and Game employees who are better able to answer your question.
When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part of an online survey, we use it to improve customer service and satisfaction. We may forward the information collected to other Fish and Game employees to perform the actual analysis. You are under no obligation to participate in such surveys.
