The Estancia Story
About Us
Estancia is translated from the Spanish word for “estate,” and emphasizes our conviction that the world’s best wines capture the essence of their place of origin. With over 30 years of experience, Estancia relies on the benefits of boutique-style winemaking techniques, including whole-cluster fermentation, gentle punch downs, and basket pressing. It is this crafting of the wines, from grapes to bottle, that results in our consistent and superior wine quality.

Monterey County
The biggest influence on the climate of Monterey County vineyards is invisible, yet its effects are undeniable. The canyon beneath Monterey Bay generates cool Pacific air that results in slow and gentle ripening of the grapes – ideal conditions for crafting excellent quality wines.
