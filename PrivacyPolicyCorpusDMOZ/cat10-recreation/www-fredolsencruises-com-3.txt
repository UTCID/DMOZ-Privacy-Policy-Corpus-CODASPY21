Address: Fred. Olsen House, White House Road, Ipswich, Suffolk, IP1 5LL

How we market
There are a few mediums through which we conduct marketing activities that require our use of people’s personal data. These are:
Online
Email
Postal
Telephone
We have detailed the way we use data to conduct these marketing activities below. We also market through press releases, billboard and publications but these do not require us to process our customers’ or prospective customers’ personal data.
Online
Social Media
What we do
We are on Facebook @fredolsencruiselines, Twitter @FredOlsenCruise, and Instagram @fred.olsencruiselines. We use these channels to promote our brand and connect with our customer base and, from time to time, advertise to potential future customers.
Some of these marketing channels allow us to place advertisements on the platform. There are several ways this can be achieved, listed below:
Uploading a post and paying to ‘boost’ the post to a specific demographic of people
With this method we do not see any of the personal information you have shared with the social media organisation but if the personal information you have shared matches the criteria for our demographic you will see the advert.
Uploading emails to the social media platform
Using this method of social media advertising we use the social media platform’s marketing engine to analyse email addresses that we upload to find similar profiles to the ones associated with the emails that we have uploaded. This practice is commonly known as ‘look-a-like’ modelling as it allows us to find potential new customers based on information on existing customer profiles.
Tracking pixel
Some social media platforms enable the ability for organisations to place a cookie or ‘pixel’ on the organisation’s website. This allows us to see the success of our social media advertising campaigns and also allow us to reach a wider audience through our advertising. We obtain your consent to place this cookie on your browser. Please refer to our cookie notice to understand how we use cookies and how you can withdraw your consent.
When we advertise through social media we never directly receive any of the information that you have submitted to the social media platform. We use the social platform as a catalyst to find the most appropriate people to present our advertisements to.
We strongly recommend that you review the privacy information of the social media platforms that you use and your privacy settings for the platform.
Web Advertising
What we do
We use online adverts to display on the internet when you browse. The placement of these adverts relies on cookies which are small files placed on your browser that personalise your internet browsing experience. The cookie obtains behavioural data about areas of the website you browse, links you click on and pages you visit.
We only place these cookies with your consent. Please refer to our cookie notice to understand how we use cookies and how you can withdraw your consent.
Email Marketing
What we do
We obtain email addresses through customers that book with us or enquire about our offering. Enquiries and bookings can come directly to us or through one of our associate Travel Agents. The Travel Agent should always make you aware that they are transferring your data to us. We can always tell you what source we received your data from and you will be able to opt-out of receiving email marketing communications when you provide your data to us and on every subsequent email communication using our unsubscribe link.
When we undertake an email marketing campaign, we design our marketing materials and select the email recipients we believe the communication would be most relevant to. As part of this process, we remove those addresses, known as having opted out email communications. We then load the email addresses into our third-party email communication platform. This platform offers a second stage of removing anyone opted out. Once this process has been completed we send the email out. We have a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with our email communication platform (Evomail).
The email communication platform also enables us to track how many unsubscribes, opens and link clicks (if there are website links in the email) have occurred.
We email market to people who have enquired with us or have made bookings previously. From time to time, we purchase lists of potential customers’ email addresses. We use the ‘soft opt-in’ provision of the Privacy and Electronics Communications Regulations (PECR) as our legal basis to conduct our marketing activities in this way, in-line with our legitimate interests as a data controller.
Postal Marketing
What we do
There are two methods we use to run a postal marketing campaign.
Mailing to people we have the address for
Mailing to people whose address we do not have; commonly known as ‘door drops’
Mailing to people we have the address for
We send out postal marketing communications to people whose addresses we have on file to promote additional options for existing bookings or our direct mail to promote our cruise programme and offers.
In order to deliver our mail to you we use a few different third parties. Often we print the name of the desired recipient and their address directly on our brochure, magazine or general mailer. To do this we use a specialist third party printing organisations to print this information directly onto the item we are sending out.
As part of this process, we use a postage consolidator. We send data to this third party so that they may process it, before printing, to increase postage efficiencies and reduce postage costs. The postage consolidator we use is Onepost.
We obtain guarantees to ensure that all third parties that we send personal data to comply with data protection regulations and our information security standards.
Mailing to people whose address we do not have
We are always interested in expanding our customer base and we use unsolicited mail as method to achieve this. When we decide to carry out an unsolicited mailing campaign we determine which area we would like to send our communications to using common providers that work off aggregated data sets such as Whistl.
When doing this type of marketing we do not base the strategy on personal data but may use information that we have obtained through bookings to determine the best geographical location to send out mailers to.
Telephone Marketing
On the Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines website we offer users the chance to request a call back. This requires the user to provide their name and telephone number in order for a member of our Reservations Department to outbound call and assist with the enquiry. This service is provided by Optilead.
We utilise marketing specific telephone numbers on promotional material to enable us to track response to specific campaigns. We also capture inbound call numbers for business intelligence reporting purposes this is a service provided to us by ResponseTap and Daisy Communications.
If we are unable to take your call we will call you back on the number that you have called on. If you have booked or enquired with us previously we can contact you about related products. You can always opt-out of telephone calls.
Your rights and our commitment to ethical marketing practices
We are committed to ensuring that we only market through ethical practices. We uphold your rights with respect to privacy and data protection. These rights are:
Right to information on how your data is processed
Right of access to the personal data we hold on you
Right to rectify any inaccurate data we process on you
Right to object to us processing your personal data
Right to erasure of your data
Right to data portability
Right to lodge a complaint with a data protection regulator
Right not to be subject to automated decision making
You can invoke any of your rights at any time using the contact details listed in this notice. Please be aware that we can ask for identification documents to confirm we are disclosing information to the correct person. If you elect a representative to invoke these rights on your behalf we will request that the representative can demonstrate they have the authority to act on your behalf and their identity.
Retention
We retain marketing data until such time as when requested to remove data or if the marketing department feel in their professional opinion it is best to remove marketing data.
Obligation to provide information
You are not obligated to provide your information for marketing purposes. However, we will use the information you disclose, when booking or enquiring with us, for marketing purposes.
Opt-out
You are always able to opt-out of marketing communications in the following ways:
For email marketing – at the time we capture your email and on the unsubscribe line at the bottom of the email
For telephone marketing – on the phone call
Social media marketing – settings on the social media platform
Postal marketing – on the mailer that has been sent there is information on how to opt-out
If you have any questions relating to opting out please contact us using the details we have provided in this notice.
Obtaining data through third parties
In such circumstance we obtain personal data through a third party we will be able to tell you our source of your data.
