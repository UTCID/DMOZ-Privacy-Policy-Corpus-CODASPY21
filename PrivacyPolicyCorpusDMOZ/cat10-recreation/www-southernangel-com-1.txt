SouthernAngel.com's Privacy Statement
Privacy Statement
Intro...
Hi! I'm Angela Gillaspie, sole owner, webmaster, queen, and head janitor of SouthernAngel.com - nice to "meet" you!
Back in March 2000, I created SouthernAngel.com with the goal of using my writing, artwork, and off-beat
point-of-view to lift my reader's spirit, heart, burden and outlook. The majority of my pages are simply
a humor or devotional column with a graphic or two.
While my job here at SouthernAngel.com is to be silly and make y'all laugh, there is one subject that
I take seriously: Your Privacy, and I have created this privacy statement to display my commitment to your privacy.
SouthernAngel.com's Content
SouthernAngel.com is a web site for general audiences, including adolescent, teens and adults and no content
will ever disclose any information or picture that is not appropriate for ALL audiences. If you happen to
find any offensive material here, please notify me ASAP, and I'll be more than happy to remove it,
usually within just a couple of hours.
The portion of SouthernAngel.com called "Gertie's
Wisdom from the Salt Lick" contains some potty humor. Like the rest of
SouthernAngel.com's pages, there is no profanity, violence (except for hunting and fishin', of course),
or sexual stuff, HOWEVER, there are many references to the wonders of the digestive tract, bad manners,
and alcohol consumption. Be warned dear reader, that the words, "fart" and yes, the dreaded word "poot"
do appear occasionally.
Collection of Your Personal Information
The only time SouthernAngel.com collects personally identifiable information is when the visitor
initiates contact either by ordering merchandise or by sending correspondence via email or online
form. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically
collected by SouthernAngel.com. This information can include: your IP address, browser type,
domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. I use this information for the
operation of my site, to help diagnose problems with the server, and to provide general statistics
regarding use of the SouthernAngel.com web site.
Use of your Personal Information
When someone orders merchandise, I use their personal information to complete the transaction. Credit card numbers,
bank account information, and similar sensitive data is never available to me when PayPal.com is used to
exchange monies.
SouthernAngel.com will NOT sell, rent or lease any customer lists to third parties or those evil sniveling
spammers.
