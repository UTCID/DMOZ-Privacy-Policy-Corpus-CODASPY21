SSL and TLS are industry-standard encryption protocols used to protect online transaction channels.The security of information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect user IDs and passwords; please take appropriate measures to protect this information.Here are some simple steps you can take to ensure your personal information is kept securely:Keep your booking reference confidential—When you make a booking, your journey will be assigned a unique booking reference (also known as a Passenger Name Record, or PNR), which will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. It is important that you keep your booking reference confidential at all times. Other persons may be able to access your booking details through our system if you disclose your booking reference to them;if you are traveling in a group and would prefer that your individual booking details not be available to other passengers in the group, you may choose to have each person make a separate booking (to be paid for individually).Keep your Skywards number/Business Rewards number/customer log-in details confidential— You should not share your login details with anyone else. You should also make sure to log out when you finish using our platforms. This is especially important if you are using a publicly accessible computer.Beware of phishing—Phishing is when a malicious party represents themselves as someone else to gain information from you. Always check whether emails are actually from the sender they appear to be from. If in doubt, go directly to the sender's website; never click on links in emails, which may take you to clone websites that may collect and use your information illegally.Storage of personal informationWe keep your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, for example, to manage bookings and provide you with information about relevant Emirates products or services, as explained in this Privacy Notice. When that purpose is fulfilled, we will ensure that your information is disposed of in a secure manner.In some circumstances, we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for example, where we are required to do so to comply with legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements; to maintain an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges; or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation related to your personal information or your dealings with us.If you require further information about how we retain particular information please contact us.A cookie is a small file that is downloaded to your device.
