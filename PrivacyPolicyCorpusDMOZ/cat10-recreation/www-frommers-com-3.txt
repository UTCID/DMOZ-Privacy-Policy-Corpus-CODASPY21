Frommer Media Cookie Policy
Revised: June 27th, 2018
By accessing and using Frommer Media’s (“we” or “our”) website (“Site”), you accept our use of cookies and are agreeing to the terms of this Cookie Policy and our Privacy Notice. We may update this Cookie Statement from time to time and will post any changes on our Site here.
WHAT ARE COOKIES?
So that you can make full use of the features on the Site, your computer, mobile phone or other device (all referred to here as device) will need to accept cookies.
A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your device by your web browser when you visit a website or other service that uses cookies. Cookies are commonly used to collect information about your browsing activities in order to provide you with more relevant content and promotional materials, on and off the Site, and help us understand your interests and improve the Site.
WHEN DO COOKIES EXPIRE AND WHO PLACES THEM?
Cookies can be persistent by remaining on your device until you delete them or be based on your browsing session where they delete once you close your browser.
We use and control first-party cookies to provide functionality, content and marketing on the Site. You may encounter cookies from third-party service providers and advertising networks, that we have allowed on our Site that assist us with various aspects of our Site operations and content and to provide advertising that may be relevant to your interests.
We do not control third-party cookies or other technologies. Their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. You should make sure you are aware of how third parties will use cookies by checking the third-party’s privacy notice and/or cookie policy.
CATEGORIES OF COOKIES
Essential/Functional Cookies
These are vital for the running of our Site. They are necessary for our Site to operate and allow us to remember what choices you make and provide. For example, we use these cookies to tell if you are logged in to your account, which allows you to post on our forums.
Performance/Analytics Cookies
These cookies collect information about your use of our Site, and enable us to improve the way they work. They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Site. For example, they allow us to understand which pages are visited most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies also allow us to see overall patterns of usage at an aggregated level.
Marketing/Tracking Cookies
We use these cookies to provide advertisements that we think may be more relevant to your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. While some of these cookies are first-party cookies placed by us for our own marketing purposes, they are usually third-party cookies placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. These cookies enable the display of advertising to you based on what you have been looking at when you visit websites that use the same advertising networks.
HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?
In addition to the uses already identified above, we use cookies on our Site to:
permit your connection to our Site and distinguish you from other users, including collecting information about your computer, device, and browser, including your IP address, browser type, other software or hardware information, and your geographic location
provide some of the functionality of our Site and, potentially adjust content on our Site and in our communications with you based upon what we know about the content that you like
analyze user interaction, including collecting information about your usage of our Site, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen or interacted with to assess how our Site and content are used

MANAGING COOKIES IN YOUR BROWSER
If you wish to limit, block or delete cookies from our Site – or any other website - you can use your browser to do this. Each browser is different so check the ‘Help’ menu of your particular browser or the browser settings for your mobile device to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
If you do this, however, certain features of our Site may not work correctly or cannot be provided to you.
Most browsers will allow you to see what cookies have been stored on your device and delete them all or each one individually, block third-party cookies, block cookies from particular websites, block all cookies from being stored, or delete all cookies when you close your browser.
You should be aware that any preferences will be lost if you delete cookies. If you have opted out from any cookies, your opt-out will be lost as this functionality utilizes cookies on your device to keep track of your preference. Also, if you block cookies completely many websites will not work properly and some functionality on these websites will not work at all.
If you are primarily concerned about third-party cookies generated by advertisers, you can turn opt-out of these separately as discussed below.
