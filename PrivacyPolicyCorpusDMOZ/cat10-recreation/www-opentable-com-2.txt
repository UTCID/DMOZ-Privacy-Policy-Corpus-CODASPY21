These
OpenTable Terms of Use (this “Agreement”)
apply to your access or use of the OpenTable websites, mobile sites, and
applications (collectively, the “OpenTable Sites”) and the content,
features, and services (the “Services”) made available by OpenTable.
In
this Agreement, “OpenTable”
and “we” mean the
OpenTable company that is providing the Services to you, and with whom you are
entering into this Agreement, which depends on the country in which you reside.
To see which OpenTable entity is providing you Services, please click here. The terms “User” and “you” mean any user of the
Services. This Agreement incorporates OpenTable’s standard policies,
procedures, and terms and conditions for use of the Services that are
referenced by name or by links in this Agreement (collectively, the “OpenTable Policies”).
By
accessing or using the Services or by clicking “accept” or “agree” to this
Agreement, (1) you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be
bound by this Agreement, and (2) you represent and warrant that you are of

CONTAINING A CLASS ACTION WAIVER APPLICABLE TO USERS WHO ARE RESIDENTS OF THE

OpenTable
may update or revise this Agreement (including any OpenTable Policies) from
time to time. You agree that you will review this Agreement periodically. You
are free to decide whether or not to accept a modified version of this
Agreement, but accepting this Agreement, as modified, is required for you to
continue using the Services. You may have to click “accept” or “agree” to show
your acceptance of any modified version of this Agreement. If you do not agree
to the terms of this Agreement or any modified version of this Agreement, you
must terminate your use of the Services, in which case you will no longer have
access to your Account (as defined below). Except as otherwise expressly stated
by OpenTable, any use of the Services (e.g., the use of the Reservation
Services (as defined herein), Waitlist Services (as defined herein), Payment
Services (as defined herein), or the purchase of OpenTable Gift Card or
Merchant Gift Card (each, as defined herein)) is subject to the version of this
Agreement in effect at the time of use.
Part I - Reservation Services
1.
Restaurant Reservations.
OpenTable makes available restaurant reservation services (the “Reservation
Services”) and waitlist services (the “Waitlist Services”) through
the OpenTable Sites to User for the purpose of assisting User in securing
dining reservations or joining a waitlist at participating third-party
restaurants (each, a “Restaurant”).
In response to a User’s online request for a Restaurant reservation or to join
a waitlist through the OpenTable Sites, OpenTable contacts the Restaurant’s
computerized database of reservations and waitlists, as applicable. The
availability of reservations, estimated wait time or place in line on a
waitlist is determined at the time of User’s query and based on information
provided to OpenTable by the Restaurant. Once a reservation or waitlist request
is made by User through the OpenTable Sites, OpenTable will provide
confirmation of the reservation or waitlist status to User by email or other
electronic messages as has been agreed to by User. By using the Reservation
Services or Waitlist Services, User agrees to receive reservation and waitlist
confirmations, updates, modifications and/or cancellations by email or other
electronic messages.
2.
No-Show Policy.
OpenTable is committed to providing superior quality services to Users and
Restaurants. To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service
for the Restaurants and their patrons, Users must cancel any reservations that
they will be unable to honor at least 30 minutes in advance of the reservation.
You may cancel your reservation via the OpenTable Sites or by calling the
Restaurant directly. Some Restaurants may require a debit or credit card number
to finalize your reservation.  In order to use the Reservation Services
for these Restaurants, you must provide valid debit or credit card information.
To confirm that the debit or credit card information you have provided is
accurate, we may place a temporary authorization on your debit or credit card
at the time you provide your debit or credit card information. After we verify
that your debit or credit card information is accurate, usually within a few
days, the authorization will be removed. You may be required to cancel your
reservation in accordance with the Restaurant’s cancellation policy, which is
disclosed at the time the reservation is made. OpenTable uses this debit or
credit card information as described in our privacy policy and shall have no liability for any
charges made to the debit or credit card account for any failure to cancel your
reservation in accordance with a Restaurant’s cancellation policy.
If
you are unable to keep your reservation and you fail to cancel at least 30
minutes in advance of the reservation, OpenTable will send you an email letting
you know that our records indicate that you were a no-show. Upon arriving at
the Restaurant, it is the User’s responsibility to notify the host that the
User has a reservation. By using the Reservation Services, User agrees to
receive no-show notifications by email after a report that your reservation was
not honored, whether or not that was in fact the case. Your Account will be
suspended if you are a no-show for four reservations within a 12-month period.
If you receive a no-show notification email in error, please click here for information on how to dispute it.
User agrees that all final no-show determinations will be made by OpenTable in
its sole discretion.
If
you wish to remove yourself from a waitlist you have joined through the
Waitlist Services, you can do so by managing your place in line through the
OpenTable Sites or by calling the Restaurant. Failure to appear at the
Restaurant in a timely manner may result in the Restaurant bypassing your place
on the waitlist for other guests or removing you from the waitlist entirely.
3.
OpenTable Dining Rewards.
Depending on your country of residency, you may be able to participate in
OpenTable’s rewards program (“OpenTable
Dining Rewards”). Where applicable, participation is subject to
the OpenTable Dining Rewards Terms and
Conditions.
4.
Usage Guidelines.
User agrees to use the Reservation Services or Waitlist Services only to book
reservations or join waitlists at Restaurants and then honor those reservations
or waitlist requests by arriving at the Restaurants on time and ordering and
paying for meals. User further agrees not to book more than one reservation or
join more than one waitlist for User’s personal use during any one meal time
(e.g., lunch, dinner, etc.). Administrative assistant and/or concierges may be
able to book multiple reservations through OpenTable’s Administrative Assistant
and/or Concierge programs, subject to any applicable program terms. Resale or
attempted resale of reservations or waitlist spots is prohibited and is grounds
for, among other things, cancellation of your reservations, removal from the
waitlist or termination of your access to the Services.
Part II – Payment, Gift Card and Other Services
5. Payment,
Gift Card and Other Services. Depending on your country of
residency, OpenTable may offer additional Services such as payment services
made available by OpenTable through the OpenTable Sites (the “Payment
Services”), electronic and physical gift cards and gift certificates issued
by OpenTable (each, an “OpenTable Gift Card”), electronic gift cards and
gift certificates issued by participating third-party restaurants (each, a “Merchant
Gift Card”) and other services. The additional terms applicable to such
Services are available here, and form a part of this Agreement: click here.
Part III – Terms for All Services
6. Privacy Policy. OpenTable is
committed to helping you safeguard your privacy online. Please review our privacy policy for details about how we collect,
use, and disclose information in connection with the Services.
7. Your Account. You may (but are
not required to) create an account with OpenTable through the OpenTable Sites
(“Account”) in order to use the Reservation Services, Waitlist Services
or to purchase, gift, or redeem (as applicable) OpenTable Gift Cards and
Merchant Gift Cards. However, you must have an Account in order to use the
Payment Services. When registering for an Account, you must provide true,
accurate, current, and complete data about yourself on the OpenTable
registration form (“Registration Data”). You also agree to promptly
update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account
and the information in your Account, and, except as otherwise required by
applicable law, you are solely responsible for all use of your Account, whether
or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify OpenTable of any
unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security related to
your use of the Services.

you use our Sites and Services, OpenTable may communicate with you via
electronic messages, including email, text message/SMS, or mobile push
notifications in accordance with our privacy policy.
9. Technical Requirements. Use of
the Services requires Internet access through your computer or mobile device.
You are responsible for all mobile carrier data or text message charges
resulting from your use of the Services, including from any notifications
provided by the Services. In order to use the text message based services, you
must maintain an active account with a carrier of electronic communications
through mobile devices and you may not use a prepaid cellular phone to access
such text message services. OpenTable does not guarantee that the Services will
be compatible with all devices or will be supported by all mobile carriers. You
may be required to have JavaScript (or similar technologies) enabled to use the
OpenTable Site, and some features and portions of the OpenTable Site
(including, but not limited to, making, modifying, or canceling reservations)
may not be accessible with JavaScript disabled.
10. Modifications to Services.
OpenTable reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the Services
from time to time and without notice, including, without limitation, by
removing, adding, or modifying portions of the OpenTable Sites, Restaurants,
and/or Merchants. OpenTable shall have no liability to you for any of the
foregoing actions. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse shall
be to cease using the Services. Continued use of the Services following any
such changes shall indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and
satisfaction with all the Services.
11. Intellectual Property Rights and Grant of Rights
to User. The features, information, and materials provided and
depicted through the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, patent,
and other intellectual property laws. All text, graphical content, video, data,
and other content made available through the Services (collectively, the “OpenTable Content”) are provided
to User by OpenTable or its partners or licensors solely to support User’s
permitted use of the Services. The OpenTable Content may be modified from time
to time by OpenTable in its sole discretion. Except as expressly set forth
herein, no license is granted to User for any other purpose, and any other use
of the Services or the OpenTable Content by User shall constitute a material
breach of this Agreement. OpenTable and its partners or licensors retain all
rights in the Services and OpenTable Content and any associated patents,
trademarks, copyrights, mask work rights, trade secrets, or other intellectual
property rights. No license, right, or interest in any trademarks of OpenTable
or any third party is granted under this Agreement.
12. Application License. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, OpenTable grants User a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the OpenTable mobile
applications, in object code form only, on User’s compatible mobile devices,
solely to support User’s permitted use of the Services.
13. Use Restrictions. The Services
and OpenTable Content are offered solely for User’s personal use for the
purposes described in this Agreement. Any and all other uses are prohibited.
OpenTable expressly reserves all its rights and remedies under applicable laws
(including state, federal, and provincial/territorial laws). OpenTable reserves
the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse service, terminate Accounts,
remove or edit content, cancel reservations, or deny access to the Services.
You agree not to (and not to allow any third party to): (1) use any deep-link,
robot, spider, scraper, or other automatic or manual device, process, or means
to access, copy, search, or monitor any portion of the Services or OpenTable
Content, except as expressly authorized by OpenTable; (2) take any action that
imposes or may impose (in OpenTable’s sole determination) an unreasonable or a
disproportionately large load on the Services or OpenTable’s infrastructure;
(3) utilize any device, software, or routine that will interfere or attempt to
interfere with the functionality of the Services; (4) rent, lease, copy,
provide access to or sublicense any portion of the Services or OpenTable
Content to a third party; (5) use any portion of the Services or OpenTable
Content to provide, or incorporate any portion of the Services or OpenTable
Content into, any product or service provided to a third party; (6) reverse
engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise seek to obtain the source code
or non-public APIs to the Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by
applicable law (and then only upon advance notice to OpenTable); (7) modify any
Services or OpenTable Content or create any derivative product from any of the
foregoing; (8) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in
the Services or OpenTable Content; (9) use the Services or OpenTable Content
for any illegal purpose; or (10) publicly disseminate information regarding the
performance of the Services or OpenTable Content or access or use the Services
or OpenTable Content for competitive analysis or benchmarking purposes.
Although the OpenTable Sites may be accessible worldwide, not all features or
services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through or on the OpenTable
Sites are available to all persons or in all geographic locations, or
appropriate or available for use outside the United States. OpenTable reserves
the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any
feature or service to any person or geographic area.
14. United
States Government End Users. The Services constitute a “commercial item” as
defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and
“commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire any OpenTable Sites
with only those rights set forth therein.
15. Export Control. You may not use,
export, or re-export any OpenTable Sites or other aspects of the Services (or
any copy or adaptation of the foregoing) in violation of applicable law,
including, without limitation, United States and foreign export laws and
regulations. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country
that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the
U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country and that you are not listed
on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
16. Termination. OpenTable may
suspend your ability to use all or any element of the Services or may terminate
this Agreement effective immediately, without notice or explanation. Without
limiting the foregoing, OpenTable may suspend your access to the Services if we
believe you to be in violation of any part of this Agreement (including any
OpenTable Policies). After any suspension or termination, you may or may not be
granted permission to use the Services or re-establish an Account, and, where
applicable, you may lose access to and be unable to use any accumulated dining
points as described in the OpenTable Dining Rewards Terms and
Conditions. You
agree that OpenTable shall not be liable to you for any termination of this
Agreement or for any effects of any termination of this Agreement. You are
always free to discontinue your use of the Services at any time. You understand
that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored
in your Account for which OpenTable will have no liability whatsoever.
17.
Reviews, Comments, Communications, and Other Content. The Services may
permit you to submit, transmit, post or otherwise provide content, including,
but not limited to, reviews, comments, ratings, photos, images, videos, sounds,
text, data, links and location information; send emails and other
communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other
information (“User Content”). Any such User Content must not be illegal,
threatening, obscene, racist, defamatory, libelous, pornographic, infringing of
intellectual property rights, promoting of illegal activity or harm to groups
and/or individuals, invasive of a third party’s publicity or privacy rights,
purposely false or otherwise injurious to third parties, or objectionable and
must not consist of or contain software, computer viruses, commercial
solicitation, political campaigning, chain letters, mass mailings, any form of
“spam” or references to illegal activity, malpractice, purposeful overcharging,
false advertising, or health code violations (e.g., foreign objects in food,
food poisoning, etc.). Your User Content should be unbiased and objective. You
may not submit reviews, comments or ratings for which you are being compensated
in any manner, or for your own restaurant or any restaurant of your employer,
friend, relative or a competitor. You may not use a false email address,
impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of User
Content. The name or handle you choose to provide to OpenTable may be displayed
publicly with such User Content. OpenTable reserves the right (but has no
obligation) to monitor, remove, or edit User Content in OpenTable’s sole
discretion, including if User Content violates this Agreement (including any
OpenTable Policies), but you acknowledge that OpenTable may not regularly
review submitted User Content. If you do submit User Content, and unless we
indicate otherwise, you grant OpenTable a nonexclusive, perpetual,
royalty-free, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable (through multiple tiers,
including to restaurants, partners and other third party websites and feeds)
right to use, modify, reproduce, adapt, translate, publish, create derivative
works from, distribute, display, and otherwise exploit such User Content
throughout the world in any media, and, where applicable, you hereby waive any
privacy or publicity rights  or any similar rights in an individual’s name
or likeness in addition to any moral or other rights you may have in the User
Content you submit in favor of OpenTable. You represent that you own, or have
the necessary permissions to use and authorize the use of User Content as
described herein. OpenTable takes no responsibility and assumes no liability
for any User Content submitted by you or any other User or third party, nor do
we guarantee any confidentiality with respect to User Content.
18. Your Representations and Indemnity.
You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights
to any User Content submitted by you; that all User Content submitted by you is
accurate; and that exploitation of such User Content by OpenTable and its other
Users, partners, and licensees will not violate this Agreement, cause injury to
any person or entity, or infringe any third-party rights (including, without
limitation, intellectual property rights and rights of privacy or publicity).
You will indemnify, hold harmless, and (at OpenTable’s request) defend
OpenTable, its affiliates, and its and their representatives, agents,
directors, managers, officers, employees, and shareholders (collectively, the “OpenTable Parties”) from and
against all claims resulting from (1) any User Content submitted by you, (2)
your use of the Services, or (3) any breach or alleged breach by you of this
Agreement.
19. Liability Limitations. EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SPECIFIED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE OPENTABLE PARTIES BE LIABLE
FOR ANY INJURIES, LOSSES, CLAIMS, OR DIRECT DAMAGES OR ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER BASED IN
CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES, WHICH ARISE OUT OF OR ARE ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH (1) THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY CHANGES THERETO), (2) ANY USE OF THE OPENTABLE SITES, SERVICES,
THE OPENTABLE CONTENT, OR THE USER CONTENT, (3) ANY FAILURE OR DELAY
(INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE ANY COMPONENT OF
ANY OF THE SERVICES), OR (4) YOUR VISIT TO ANY RESTAURANT OR THE PERFORMANCE,
NON-PERFORMANCE, CONDUCT, OR POLICIES OF ANY RESTAURANT OR MERCHANT IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, YOU SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTAND AND
AGREE THAT ANY THIRD PARTY DIRECTING YOU TO THE OPENTABLE SITE BY REFERRAL,
LINK, OR ANY OTHER MEANS IS NOT LIABLE TO USER FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES OR LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE
SERVICES OR THE OPENTABLE CONTENT. OPENTABLE IS NEITHER AN AGENT OF NOR
OTHERWISE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY RESTAURANT FOR WHICH A USER HAS MADE A
RESERVATION, CLAIMED AN OFFER OR PROMOTION, OR PAID A BILL USING THE PAYMENT
SERVICES OR ANY MERCHANT THAT ISSUES A MERCHANT GIFT CARD. IFYOU ARE A RESIDENT
OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OR EUROPEAN UNION, THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IN THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY DAMAGE ARISING FROM OUR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AND
GROSS NEGLIGENCE, NOR SHALL IT APPLY TO DAMAGE FROM INJURY TO LIFE, BODY OR
HEALTH.
IF
THE DISCLAIMER OF DIRECT DAMAGES ABOVE IS NOT ENFORCEABLE AT LAW, EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE GIFT CARD TERMS, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT
OUR LIABILITY TO YOU (FOR AY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE
ACTION) WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO FIFTY US DOLLARS ($50).
You
and OpenTable understand and agree that the disclaimers, exclusions, and
limitations in this Section 19 and in Section 20 are essential elements of this
Agreement and that they represent a reasonable allocation of risk. In
particular, you understand that OpenTable would be unable to make the Services
available to you except on these terms and agree that this Agreement will survive and
apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have
failed of its essential purpose.
20. Disclaimer of Warranties. YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND OPENTABLE CANNOT
GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  THE SERVICES, ALL OPENTABLE CONTENT,
AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, AND MATERIALS CONTAINED IN OR ACCESSED
THROUGH THE SERVICES, ARE PROVIDED TO USER ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AND WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. OPENTABLE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, OR INDEMNITIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ,
TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY WARRANTY ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING,
PERFORMANCE, OR TRADE USAGE. OPENTABLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE
SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT OPENTABLE WILL REVIEW THE
INFORMATION OR MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES FOR ACCURACY OR
THAT IT WILL PRESERVE OR MAINTAIN ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR MATERIALS WITHOUT
LOSS. OPENTABLE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE
FAILURES, OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF OPENTABLE.
THE
FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU MAY
HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED
WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
21. Third-Party Websites, Applications and Services.
The Services may contain hypertext links to websites and applications operated
by parties other than OpenTable. Such hypertext links are provided for User’s
reference only, and OpenTable does not control such websites and is not
responsible for their content. OpenTable’s inclusion of any hypertext links to
such websites or applications does not imply any endorsement of the material on
such websites or applications or any association with their operators.
OpenTable assumes no liability whatsoever for any such third-party websites,
applications or any content, features, products, or services made available
through such third-party websites or applications. Additionally, Apple Inc.,
Google, Inc., Microsoft Corporation or BlackBerry Limited will be a third-party
beneficiary to this contract if you access the Services using applications
developed for Apple iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, or Blackberry-powered
mobile devices, respectively. These third party beneficiaries are not parties
to this contract and are not responsible for the provision or support of the
Services in any manner. Your access to the Services using these devices is
subject to terms set forth in the applicable third party beneficiary's terms of
service, including any license transferability and other usage rules therein.
22. Release. Restaurants and
Merchants are solely responsible for their interactions with you and any and
all claims, injuries, illnesses, damages, liabilities, and costs (“Claims”) suffered by you (or, if
applicable, any recipient of an OpenTable Gift Card or a Merchant Gift Card) as
a result of your (or such recipient’s) interaction with or visit to any
Restaurant or Merchant or from any promotion, offer, product or service of any
Restaurant or Merchant. Users must resolve all disputes directly with
Restaurants. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby
release the OpenTable Parties from any and all such Claims. IN CONNECTION WITH
THE FOREGOING, IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA
CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO
CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR
AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE
MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” You hereby
expressly waive and relinquish all rights and benefits under that section and
any law of any jurisdiction of similar effect with respect to the release of
any unknown or unsuspected claims you may have against the OpenTable Parties
pertaining to the subject matter of this Section 22. If you are a resident of
the United Kingdom or European Union, this release shall not apply to any
damage arising from our willful misconduct or gross negligence, nor shall it
apply to damage from injury to life, body or health.
23.

If you believe any of the Services violate your copyright, notify our copyright
agent in writing. The contact information for our copyright agent is at
the bottom of this Section.
In
order for us to take action, you must do the following in your notice:
(a)
provide your physical or electronic signature;
(b)
identify the copyrighted work that you believe is being infringed;
(c)
identify the item that you think is infringing your work and include sufficient

(d)
provide us with a way to contact you, such as your address, telephone number,

(e)

identified as infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent,
or the law to be used in connection with the Services; and
(f)

accurate, and that (under penalty of perjury) you are authorized to act on
behalf of the copyright owner whose work is being infringed.
Here
is the contact information for our copyright agent:
Copyright

OpenTable,
Inc.

Again,
we cannot take action unless you give us all the required information.
24.
Severability.
If any of the provisions, or portions thereof, of this Agreement are found to
be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, then, that provision
(or portion thereof) notwithstanding, this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed omitted.
25.
Assignment.
This Agreement and the rights granted and obligations undertaken hereunder may
not be transferred, assigned, or delegated in any manner by User, but may be
freely transferred, assigned, or delegated by OpenTable.
26.
Waiver. Any
waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or a delay by any party in the
enforcement of any right hereunder, shall neither be construed as a continuing
waiver nor create an expectation of non-enforcement of that or any other
provision or right.
27.ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER,
CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE.
If
you are a resident of the United States (including its possessions and
territories) or Canada, you agree that any and all controversies, disputes,
demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and
scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand,
count, claim, or cause of action) between you and the OpenTable Parties or
their successors or assigns shall exclusively be settled through binding and
confidential arbitration. If you are a resident in Mexico, you hereby expressly
waive any right to exercise a class action before a Mexican court against OpenTable and OpenTable Parties,
pursuant to the terms of the Federal Code of Civil Procedure (CódigoFederal de ProcedimientosCiviles)
and any other applicable Mexican legislation.
Arbitration
shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state or
provincial/territorial arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted
before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving
commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). As modified by this
Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the
arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them
applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”).
In
the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you are thus agreeing to
GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for
matters that you file in small claims court. Your rights will be determined by
a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR
HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE
LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as
enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY
A COURT.
In
the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you and OpenTable must
abide by the following rules: (1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR OPENTABLE
MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S
CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS
PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (3) in the event that you are
able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
compared to costs of litigation, OpenTable will pay as much of your filing and
hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems
necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to
the cost of litigation; (4) OpenTable also reserves the right in its sole and
exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the
arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy
recognized at law; (6) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you
nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration,
except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the
arbitration award; (7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or
individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side
pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision
that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses,
and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the
applicable law.
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, either you or OpenTable may bring an individual action in small
claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s
patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration
agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal
courts located in San Francisco County, California. Additionally,
notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency
equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in San Francisco
County, California in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and
hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts
located within San Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for
interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
With
the exception of OpenTable
Parties (1) and (2) in this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or
collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be
invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and
Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in
effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If,
however, either subpart (1) or (2) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or
illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and
void, and neither you nor OpenTable shall be entitled to arbitration. If for
any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration (including any
claims brought by parties outside the United States or Canada), the dispute
shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in San Francisco
County, California.

another jurisdiction.  You
