Terms and ConditionsI hereby agree to comply with all the AMA SAFETY CODES, CIRCLE CITY FLYERS Field Safety and Flying rules for all model aircraft operations at all Circle City Flyers Flying Sites. I further agree to abide by and comply with the Circle City Flyers Bylaws and Standing Rules, and to any changes or modifications that may be made to them during my membership period. I understand and agree that as a condition of membership my failure to comply with all the applicable SAFETY & FLYING RULES and/or failure to conduct myself in a proper manner will result in the revoking of my membership. I understand and agree to provide the AMA and a Circle City Flyers Officer written notice within thirty (30) days of an occurrence of any incident of bodily injury and/or property damage. I am very aware that model aircraft operations present hazards, and there is an assumption of that risk. I EXEMPT AND HOLD HARMLESS CIRCLE CITY FLYERS, its OFFICERS, and MEMBERS from any and all liability including but not limited to personal injury, property damage, or death caused by me, or my guest's actions.
NOTE:You may submit an application before you receive your AMA card. Your AMA membership will be verified electronically, so please make sure your number is correct on the form. We will process your payment immediately, but your club membership card will not be issued until an active status is confirmed by the AMA. You can check your status on the AMA website.
