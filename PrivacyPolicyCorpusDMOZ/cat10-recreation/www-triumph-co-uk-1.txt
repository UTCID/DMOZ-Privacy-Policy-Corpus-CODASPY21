We collect information about you when you use our online services, when you buy products or services from us and, in some cases, on paper (e.g. when you fill in a form at a dealer or when you visit one of our stands at a show). We collect the following information when you provide it to us: your name, address and contact details.

Website usage information, collected through the use of cookies (see the cookie section below for more details).

We may use public sources of data, for example, to support website functionality (e.g. to support authentication), and/or to maintain the accuracy of the information we hold. For example, we may check with the DVLA to ensure we have accurate owner information.
Please note: Personal data collected through the American website, TriumphMotorcycles.com, is collected and stored in the USA. If you complete a form or provide personal data in any other way on this part of our site, your data will be processed in accordance with privacy laws in the USA.

We may use your data to contact you about research.
We may ask you to complete a satisfaction survey when you buy a product or service from us.
When you purchase a motorcycle we may pass your details to a third party so additional services can be offered to you, such as extended warranties
and insurance offers (please see ‘who we share your personal information with’ below).
We may also publish articles with information collected about you. This will only happen where you have sent us the information yourself or you have
consented to its use.
On occasion we may send you invitations to complete research surveys.
Who we share your information with
We may share your information with the following third party suppliers selected by Triumph:
Those third parties who need to handle it so we can deliver the products you have ordered from us.
Marketing agencies to carry out marketing activities on our behalf.

The privacy policy covers Triumph as users of the system and you as someone responding to our surveys.
We endeavour to ensure all of our third party recipients are within the European Economic Area, however sometimes your personal data may by necessity be outside of the EEA – for further information including how we safeguard your personal data, see ‘Transfer of your information out of the EEA’.

We will share personal information with law enforcement or other authorities if required by applicable law.
We will not share or sell your personal data with any other third party.
Whether information has to be provided by you, and if so why
The provision of your name, address, delivery address is required from you to enable us to provide the goods you have purchased from us.
The provision of your phone number is required from you to enable us to ensure dealerships can provide any test rides you may have requested. The provision of driving licence details is required for the same purpose.

How long your personal information will be kept
We will hold your name, address, contact details and VIN number(s) for the lifetime of the bike you have purchased, or until such time as you inform us of a change of ownership. We may also keep it to comply with our legal obligations, respond to queries and resolve any disputes, to meet our legitimate interests.
Your contact details used for marketing will be kept until you inform us that you no longer wish to receive such information from us, or until you have not interacted with Triumph for a period of 18 (eighteen) months.
Transfer of your information out of the EEA
Where Triumph Motorcycles shares personal information with a third party located outside the EEA, we conduct internal checks and use measures as approved by the European Commission to support adequate transfer of the information.
Internal checks identify if the country has been approved by the European Commission as having essentially equivalent data protection laws, or if there is a programme in place, such as the EU-US Privacy Shield programme, that the European Commission has approved as adequate. More information about the protections the European Commission has considered is available here
Your rights

These include the following: to withdraw consent where you have given it, to be informed and have access to your personal information, to be able to correct or complete inaccurate data, and in certain circumstances to restrict, request erasure, object to processing, or request portability of your personal information to another organisation.
Further information on each of these rights, including the circumstances in which they may apply, is available from the Data Protection Authority. [DPA Index]

Cookies and other tracking technology
Cookies
Cookies are small files which are stored on a user’s computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer. This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user, or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.
Triumph will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. However, if you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by Triumph websites you can do this through your browser settings. The ‘Help’ function within your browser should tell you how.
Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your machine as well as more general information about cookies.
Restricting cookies may impact on the functionality of our online services.
Please note that each online service that uses cookies should have its own cookie notice. Cookie lists:

Pixel Tags
We may use pixel tags as part of our online services. Pixel Tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage that can collect information such as:
The IP (Internet Protocol) address of the device that accessed the page containing the tag
The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears
The time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed
The type of browser that fetched the pixel tag, and
The identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.
E-mail tracking
When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, we may use 'format sensing' technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.
We may use unique hyperlinks in e-mails we send to you; this is to see if e-mails have been opened and responded to.
Do not Track (browser setting)
Our online services do not currently recognise ‘do not track’ signals.
