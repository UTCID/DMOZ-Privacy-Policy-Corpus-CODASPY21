PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY SWINKELS FAMILY BREWERS
PRIVACY POLICY
1. Introduction
Swinkels Family Brewers (hereinafter referred to as 'SFB') would like to contact you in a way that makes you feel comfortable. In this privacy and cookie policy we indicate which information we can ask of you, why we ask for this information and how you can influence it.
This privacy and cookie policy applies to all websites, online stores, social media channels, (digital) advertising campaigns, newsletters, promotions etc. of SFB and associated brands. The objective here is information that is privacy-sensitive. In short, these are all the (unique) personal details that apply to you or are traceable to you.
2. The objective of processing personal data
When using our products and services, we may collect personal data from and about you. This could be information that you provide us with when buying products via our online stores, a contact form that you fill in to contact us or information that we collect when you use our (mobile) websites, apps, online stores and other services such as online advertising campaigns, events, promotions, competitions and loyalty programmes.
We collect personal data in order to better tailor our products and services to your needs on the basis of the insights we obtain from them. We also do this for commercial reasons, namely to gain a better understanding of the products and services that you are interested in as a user and to make the advertisements that we use as relevant as possible for you.
In this document we explain, among other things, how we deal with your personal data, how and what information we (can) collect and the purposes for which we (may) use them. In addition, this document also contains information on how you can access your data, how you can change or delete data (or have these changed or deleted), and who the (possible) recipients of these data are.
3. Grounds for processing
Personal data may only be processed if there is a legal ground for this. Legal grounds on which SFB can process your personal data are:
Permission: We can speak of legally valid permission if you express in a free, informed and unambiguous way that you agree to a specific processing by SFB, such as when you register for an email newsletter.
Necessary for the execution of an agreement: Your personal data could also be processed by SFB because this is necessary for the execution of an agreement that you have or will conclude with SFB, or to take measures because of your request to conclude of an agreement.
Legal obligation: In some cases, SFB must process your personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation that lies with SFB. An example is the retention of certain data on the basis of tax legislation.
Justified interest: SFB could also process your data when this is necessary for the protection of its legitimate (business) interests or those of a third party, unless your interests, fundamental rights or fundamental freedoms outweigh these. In order to determine whether processing can take place on this legal ground, a weighing of interests must be done in advance between the interests of SFB (or a third party) and the interests of the data subjects. For example, processing for the purpose of fraud prevention (if a prior and careful weighing of interests rules in favour of the business interests) could occur on this legal ground.
4. Which data are processed?
4.a General
SFB processes personal data that are satisfactory, relevant and limited to what is necessary to achieve its intended purpose. In order to achieve this goal SFB processes, among other things (but not exclusively), data from consumers and business relations. This may include the following data:
First and last name;
Gender;
Date of birth;
Address;
Telephone number;
Email address;
Other personal data that are actively provided;
Data concerning activities on our website;
Data about your surfing behaviour on our websites;
IP address;
Location data;
Internet browser and type of device.
The above is a summary of the data we could collect. This does not mean, however, that we actively request them from everyone and retain them. It may be, for example, that the one service requires your email address, while another doesn't and uses your location instead.
4.b The provision of data is not mandatory but sometimes necessary
You are not obliged to disclose your personal details when you communicate with us. You always have the choice whether you want to provide your personal details or not.
However, in order to make use of some of our products and services, entering your personal details is necessary. For example, if you buy a product from one of our online stores, we will need your details to have the product delivered to you and to prepare an invoice. If you want to receive a newsletter or create an account for an online store or loyalty programme, then we need at least a valid email address.
4.c Participation in campaigns, prize distributions, competitions
If you participate in competitions or events we could ask you for personal details. Which details depends on the campaign, prize distribution or competition. To be able to win, we will often ask for your name, email address, home address, telephone number and answers to open questions. If it is necessary to send you the prize by post (e.g. tickets or products), we will also ask for your postal address or other specific details that we need in order to forward this prize. We need this information to process your participation and to be able to communicate with you about your prize or to send the prizes to you.
4.d       Exchange of data within SFB
We track your use of our online services by means of (a) cookie(s) (see below). The following applies here; that all SFB websites and means of communication, in principle, use the same system and that the data provided could also be combined.
In some cases we may combine your data with:
Data obtained by us when you viewed and/or clicked on one of our advertisements.
Data obtained by us when you made a purchase at one of our online stores.
Data obtained by us when you made use of our products or services.
Data obtained from other sources (e.g. via partners with whom we collaborate).
Based on the data obtained, we draw up a profile so that we can serve you better and ensure that we can be even more relevant to you.
When you complete a registration form on one of our websites, we can add the details you have entered to the cookie we use to measure your use of our online services. In addition, we do not combine all the details you enter with the online user information. We will limit ourselves to data such as your age, gender and (the digits of your) postal code. In this case the data will be used to set up an online profile.
These profiles will only be used to better tailor our offer to your interests. If you object to the exchange and combination of your personal data within SFB and its affiliated companies and/or the creation of an online profile, you can make this known via the contact form. Where possible, we will cease the processing and delete the data.
5. Use of data/data retention periods.
The period(s) during which we use the data depends on the type of information we have and how and why we have received this information.
SFB will not retain the personal data it collected for longer than is necessary to realise the purposes for which the personal data have been processed. Point of departure for SFB is that it will not retain the personal data for more than one year, unless the applicable (civil or tax) legislation prescribes a longer period. At the end of this period, the personal data will be deleted or anonymised by SFB.
For example, if you receive emails with advertising campaigns and offers of SFB products and services because you are (or have been) a customer of SFB, you will continue to receive them up to a year after purchase or use.
If you receive emails with advertising campaigns and offers of SFB products and services because you have registered for this, you will continue to receive them until you have unsubscribed.
Financial data (data relating to the purchase/sale of a product) must in many cases be retained for seven years for tax purposes.
6. SFB'S Responsibility
This privacy and cookie policy applies to the processing of data by SFB (trade name of Bavaria N.V.) and its affiliated companies. SFB is the party responsible for the processing of personal data. The brands covered by SFB include Bavaria, Swinckels', Palm, Rodenbach and La Trappe. For a complete overview of the brands reference is made to www.swinkelsfamilybrewers.com.
6.a Processors of SFB
SFB shares the personal data it processes with third parties, if it considers this necessary or useful to optimise a business process, to execute an agreement or to comply with a legal obligation. SFB enters into a processing agreement with all the companies that process personal data on behalf of SFB. This agreement must ensure an equivalent level of security and confidentiality of personal data as is customary at SFB. SFB remains responsible for this processing. Examples of third parties with whom SFB can share personal data are:
Developers of digital services;
Delivery services for our products;
Suppliers of technical platforms,
data warehouses and infrastructure management;
Payment service providers;
Suppliers of products;
Debt collection services;
Analytics and data management services;
Companies that conduct market research and customer surveys;
Marketing services (CRM/email marketing platforms, marketing agencies);
Customer Service;
Advertising agencies and ad-tech vendors.
Finally, we can share certain anonymised data with third parties, such as the number of users searching for a particular term, or how many users clicked on an ad. You cannot be identified on the basis of this data.
6.b Transfer of data to third parties in other countries and security
When we pass on personal data to third parties causing the personal data to be processed in countries outside the European Economic Area, we will ensure that the data are transferred and processed in a manner that is permitted under applicable privacy legislation.
In the processing of personal data we will, at all times, maintain a level of security which, in view of the state of technology, is appropriate to prevent unauthorised access to and adaptation, disclosure or loss of personal data. This could include both technical and organisational measures (such as encryption of data, a limited group of employees who have access to the data, pseudonymisation of data, anonymisation of data, etc.).
6.c Young people
Not yet 18 years old? In that case it is not possible to make use of our services and/or products. We will ask for your date of birth by means of an "age check" to determine whether you are 18 years (or another statutory age) or older.
7. Rights and Contact
Through this privacy and cookie policy we wish to provide clarity about the way in which we handle your data. If you have questions about this document or the processing of data by SFB, or if you want to exercise your rights as a data subject (request for access, adaptation or deletion of data, objection to processing, restriction of processing or data portability) you can contact us via the below contact details or via the contact form.
