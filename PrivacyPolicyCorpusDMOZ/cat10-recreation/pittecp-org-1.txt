PRIVACY POLICY
The Explorers Club of Pittsburgh (ECP) only uses membership data for Club purposes. Information collected is limited to that which is necessary for the efficient functioning of the ECP and for the safety of its members. We will not give, sell or trade membership data with outside organizations.
Personal information shall be stored securely online and shall be protected by a password. Access shall be limited to Club Officers. Private member information may not be disclosed to anyone outside the Board.  Names & years of membership of former members will be retained in the membership database & club archives. Other items such as contact information will be expunged from the database upon the request of the former member.
The Members list is never to be given or sold to any publishing house or place of business for commercial use unless approved by Membership vote.
Members have the option to make their names and email addresses available to the current membership in order to facilitate communication within the club.  Members may also choose make their telephone number available. In all cases, sharing such information shall require the explicit consent of the member, and it may not be shared outside of the Club.
Adopting the motto "Research, Education, and Adventure" in 1947, for
three generations the ECP has provided the opportunity to learn new
skills and meet new friends who share a willingness to accept the
physical and mental challenges of outdoor exploration and adventure.
