When you submit a Contact form on the web site, the personal information, questionnaire responses, and/or message contents will be recorded on the Site and will be accessed by representatives of The Daguerreian Society. We may keep information submitted through a Contact form perpetually, but do not use such information for unrelated marketing activities, and do not share it with third parties for any purpose.
Cookies
If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

Links to third party websites
The Site, and our electronic communications, may from time to time contain links to third party web sites. If you follow any such a link, note that you are leaving the Site and accessing another web site that will have its own privacy policies. The Daguerreian Society does not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
Analytics
The Site may use third party analytics services in order to improve the functionality and performance of the Site. This allows us to provide a high quality web site experience.
Who we share your data with
TBD
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their own personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information (except for user passwords).
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Where we send your data
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
Your contact information
Any correspondence regarding the use of your personal information may be sent to the physical mail address listed above, to the email address info@daguerreiansociety.org, or to the Site using this contact form.
Additional information
How we protect your data
Personal membership data such as names and contact information, including data available through members search or member profiles, are only available to members when logged in to the Site using the member's secret password. Except for certain basic membership data, each member individually opts in or out to sharing personal data with other members.

With the possible exception of analytics relating to Site use or performance, the Site does not receive data about its users from third parties.

The Site does not perform any automated decision making. All changes and decisions are made by humans.
