Oxygen Administration
You are here:TrainingSkill Development CoursesSafety and rescue coursesOxygen Administration
Share this page
The administration of oxygen is a way of increasing the effectiveness of first aid treatment for diving accidents. Being qualified in its use gives you the confidence to treat a diving-related injury either on a boat or on dry land.
O2 Admin consolidates the life support skills taught in BSAC’s Diver Training Programme. I found the course invaluable and now know that I could effectively respond in a real life situation. I’m also keeping my skills up to date and passing them on by teaching the course in my club.
- Carol Wood, iDive (Ipswich SAC)
