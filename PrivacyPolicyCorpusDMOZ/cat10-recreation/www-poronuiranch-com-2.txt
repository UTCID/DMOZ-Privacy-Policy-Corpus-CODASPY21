Testimonial
If you're craving nature, but you don't want to be deprived of comfort or luxury, set a course for Poronui Lodge - preferably by helicopter, although a car will do. Forty minutes from Taupo along SH5, Poronui (Maori for "part of something bigger") is approached through towering working forests and is regarded as one of the world's finest luxury wilderness lodges. Set on 8200ha of farmland, you'll be torn between staying in the lavish lodge, in one of the cabins, or going glamping down by the river. Fly-fishing and hunting are the main attractions but you can also go horse riding, mountain biking, enjoy cultural experiences or spa treatments. This is the kind of place where, whatever you want, you can have it.
Elisabeth Easther - December 2015
New Zealand's Premier Sporting Lodge
To discriminating anglers and sportsmen, Poronui is an historic sporting lodge where they can fish for wild trout in pristine waters or hunt majestic deer in hauntingly beautiful landscapes.
To outdoor adventure enthusiasts, Poronui the opportunity to explore 16,000 acres of timeless private New Zealand wilderness by foot, horse or mountain bike.
To all, Poronui is genuine kiwi hospitality, great food made with local ingredients, a place to escape from the pressures of everyday life and a place to make memories which will last a lifetime.
