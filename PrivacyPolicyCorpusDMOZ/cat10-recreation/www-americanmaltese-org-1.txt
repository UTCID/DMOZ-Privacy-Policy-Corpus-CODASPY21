The AMA neither endorses products nor services nor the content of communications, postings or data, nor assumes any responsibility for any threatening, libelous, obscene, harassing or offensive material contained in such materials or any crime facilitated by use of the Sites.
To report any violations of the Terms of Service, please use the “Contact Web Services” links on our website to notify us of a possible violation.  Our club's Board of Directors will review all comments and take appropriate action for each.
Any AMA online communities should be friendly, informative and enjoyable for all of our members and the general public.  We reserve the right, but shall not be obligated to remove any material that does not comply with our Terms of Service without prior warning or further explanation.  We also reserve the right to revoke posting privileges at our discretion and without warning.
You agree that when using these forums, you will act in a manner consistent with the goals of the AMA, and by way of example, and not as a limitation, you specifically agree and understand that:
a. You will not violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, including but not limited to any rule, regulation, decree or ordinance.
b. You will not post information on or download information from any of the Sites unless you have all rights and authority necessary to do so.
c. You will not post any inappropriate, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, potentially libelous or slanderous, infringing, harmful, harassing, threatening, illegal or other material or information that AMA in its sole discretion views as objectionable, including but not limited to text, graphics, audio and video files.
d. You will not defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten, embarrass, cause distress, unwanted attention or discomfort or otherwise violate the legal rights (including without limitation rights of privacy and publicity) of any User or representative of AMA.
e. You may express your disagreement with someone’s point-of-view but personal attacks, or attacks based on another person’s race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or other such condition or circumstance, are strictly prohibited.
f. You will not impersonate another person or entity, including but not limited to an AMA representative, or communicate under a false name or a name that you are not entitled or authorized to use.
g. You will not post surveys, contests, chain letters, pyramid schemes, unnecessarily long messages, unnecessary or repetitive posts, multiple ratings for the same item, meaningless text, spamming, offensive declarations or other similarly disruptive content.
h. You will not falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices or proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or other material posted on the Sites.
I. You will not post files that contain viruses, corrupted files or other similar software, programs or routines that may damage the operation of another computer or any of the AMA's sites.
j. You will not attempt to “crack,” “hack,” “bomb,” manipulate or otherwise gain unauthorized access to another User’s user name(s) or other information, AMA servers, AMA software or areas of the Sites not intended for your access.
k. You will not post, transmit or distribute any unsolicited advertising, promotional materials or other forms of solicitation to Users, individuals or entities, except in areas designated by AMA for such purposes.
l. You will not harvest, mine or otherwise collect or store personal information about others, including without limitation e-mail addresses and User profiles.
m. You will not use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses any Site in a manner that sends more request messages to the AMA servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, AMA grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from any Site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.  AMA reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.
n. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including without limitation usernames, from any Site or to use the communication systems provided by any Site for any commercial solicitation purpose.
o. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, Users of the Sites.
p. Any personal information you reveal can be obtained and used by others. Anything you say here, you say at your own risk. Do not provide anyone with any information that you don't want made public.
q. When participating in an online conversation, never assume that people are who they say they are, know what they say they know, or are affiliated with whom they say they are affiliated.
r. If we judge a submission inappropriate, we reserve the right to delete that post and all replies to it. Re-posts of previously deleted contributions will be treated in the same way.  Judgments concerning posts are made at our discretion, and our decisions are considered final.
