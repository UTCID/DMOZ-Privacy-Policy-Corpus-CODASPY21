“Spirit of Life is a centre which is completely
of our time, combining the very best of holistic healing within a very inspirational
setting. I congratulate Kerry and the team on taking this leap of faith
in setting up the Centre and I know that many will find the deeper healing
they seek at the Spirit of Life Centre.”

Author of ‘healing foods’ and campaigner for integrated medicine.
