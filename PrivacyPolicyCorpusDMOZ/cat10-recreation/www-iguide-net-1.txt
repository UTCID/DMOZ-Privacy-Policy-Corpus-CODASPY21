What is iGuide™?
The i is for INFO.
iGuide™ is millions of WEB pages, each devoted to an individual object in
the Art, Antiques, Collectibles and Memorabilia fields. Dozens of categories are
included in the database, from baseball cards and comic books to movie posters,
zippo lighters, and everything in between. And we are growing! New pages are being
added daily. iGuide?empowers you with price information. iGuide gives you an edge.

What is "Real Market Data"?
Wouldn't it be great if you could determine what price constitutes a "fair
deal" before you made a deal? We think so. That's why we've created iGuide's
Real Market Data (RMD) pricing, our proprietary system that does the research for
you. It's a guide that gives you updated information on what you should pay for
an item or what you should expect to receive ?without having to spend hours researching.
iGuide's Real Market Data pricing system is the internet's best guide to market
value pricing and the only pricing system designed with the consumer in mind. Our
exclusive RMD pricing is based on real sales data, gathered from auction sites in
near real-time. This ensures you get the most accurate pricing available, as quickly
as possible!
Get iGuide?For Your Site
If you have a website that is targeted toward consumers, we encourage you to add
our Real Market Data Search Box to your Web site. We've made the process simple,
quick and painless ?and implementation is free. These are low-bandwidth tools that
allow you to offer up-to-date, unbiased pricing to your Web site users.

Who Started iGuide?

providing pricing information to collectors. He is an internationally recognized
antiques and collectibles expert, authoring numerous price guides, including Wizard:

Poster Price Guide, and many others. He was the senior price guide editor for Wizard
Magazine, Toyfare Magazine, and Inquest magazine from 1993 to 2003. Prior to that,
he was the senior editor of The Overstreet Update, a market research guide for collectors
of rare comic books. He was the Vice President of Market Research for an 8-million
dollar venture capital funded website, Wizardworld.com, in 2000 and 2001 (it died
in the dotcom crash). He was Publisher of Collecting Hollywood Magazine and Comics
