LIVEATC.NET TERMS OF USE
To make it easier to understand the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, I thought that we would start by highlighting some things in plain English. This summary is not a legal document. You'll want to read the complete Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, but here's what we consider some of the key elements:
Terms:
1) We expect you to keep any account passwords and other secure information to yourself.
2) LiveATC.net is for non-commercial (personal) use only - that means you can't use LiveATC.net and the audio streams here for personal gain, financial or otherwise.
3) You can't produce and distribute a dedicated desktop or mobile application designed to make the LiveATC.net Services directly available, without the consent of or a contract with LiveATC.net.
4) Since there are only limited numbers of connections available for streams, and because the site is funded through advertising and donations, you agree to consult LiveATC.net prior to linking directly to any of the audio streams.
When you do link you agree to give credit to LiveATC.net with a prominent link to www.liveatc.net.
5) You will not use the LiveATC.net web site for any aviation, commercial, operational, law enforcement, or judicial activity that relies on the availability, validity, or accuracy of LiveATC.net data.
While it contains authentic ATC broadcasts, it is for training and entertainment purposes only.
6) You will not disguise the origin of your connection to the LiveATC.net web site.
7) You will not provide false or inaccurate information to the LiveATC.net web site.
8) You will not use the LiveATC.net web site for the purpose of conducting illegal activity.
9) You will not access the LiveATC.net web site in any way that intentionally affects or significantly negatively impacts the performance or reliability of the LiveATC.net web site or the LiveATC.net audio streaming network.
10) You will only access the LiveATC.net web site with an interactive web browser (or other authorized agents, which include general purpose media players) and not with any program, collection agent, or "robot" for the purpose of automated retrieval of content, unless you are granted permission by LiveATC.net to do so.
11) You acknowledge that any ideas, concepts, techniques, ("suggestions") for new or existing services submitted to LiveATC.net or discussed on the LiveATC.net ATC Discussion Forums are not confidential or proprietary. LiveATC.net will have an unrestricted, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty free right to use, disseminate, display, distribute, and exploit any suggestions.
12) LiveATC.net has the right to moderate any and all conversations, discussions, topics, posts, and images, in the LiveATC.net Discussion Forums without prejudice.
13) Your use of LiveATC.net in any way means you agree to the Terms of Use.
Privacy:
We'll only send you emails if you sign up. We'll never give or sell your email address to another company. We hate spam, too.
If you come to LiveATC.net directly from a partner site, we may share some of your information with the partner that sent you to LiveATC.net. If that's the case, we'll tell you directly that we're going to do so.
No surprises.
Other than that one case, we won't share any information that identifies you as an individual with any other third party. Ever.
If you decide to publicly post your personal information in our forum, we can't be responsible for what happens to that information. Post wisely.
We take great care to ensure that any personal information you store on LiveATC.net is secure and safeguarded at all times.
