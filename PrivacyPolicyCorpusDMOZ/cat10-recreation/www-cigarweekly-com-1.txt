Information this Site Gathers
Cigarweekly.com is a web site that publishes information about cigars, pipes, tobacco and cigar related products and activities and supports a community of like minded individuals who enjoy smoking cigars, pipes, and tobacco products, as well as other lifestyle information of interest to our users. The community is manifested in the form of a Bulletin Board (BBS) that prompts each user for their name and email address.
The web server records IP addresses of visitors to the site. The time and IP address of the most recent visit to some parts of the site by BBS users who have logged in is recorded by the BBS software. Posting on the BBS records the IP address of the system connecting to the server and associates it with the post.
Use of the Information this Site Gathers
The information gathered by registering for the bulletin board is used for contacting the user for notification of BBS related events and occasional news letter releases.
IP addresses that are logged by the general server are used for system administration purposes and in an aggregated form to verify our traffic for performance analysis and advertiser related statistics.
IP addresses of users who have not logged in to the BBS are not linked to any personally identifiable information and thus remain anonymous. IP addresses of systems used to post message on the BBS may be used to correlate information about a poster.
Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers
The information gathered from the bulletin board and any other parts of the site are not shared with anyone. Marketing information may be aggregated and used to describe our audience for potential advertisers on the site.
Opt-out Policy
To opt out of the community please contact the webmaster and request that your account be deactivated.
Correct/Update Policy
If you would like to correct and/or update your personally identifiable information, please use the profile link in the BBS or contact the webmaster.
