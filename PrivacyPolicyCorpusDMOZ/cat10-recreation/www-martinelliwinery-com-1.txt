Notice
MVI uses personal information to better understand your needs and interest and provide you with better service. Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with MVI. We take seriously the trust you place in us. MVI will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others.
This privacy statement covers personally identifiable information, anonymous data collection and aggregate reporting. Personally identifiable information is any information that is associated with your name or personal identity. Anonymous (non-personal) information is data about usage and service operation, reported in aggregate, which is not associated to a specific personal identity. Aggregate information is data collected and summarized for a broad category of customers.
What we collect
On the MVI web site, you can make information requests or register yourself. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, phone, email address, user IDs and passwords, and contact preferences.
Anonymous (non-personal) data we collect may include the pages visited on HTTP://WWW.MARTINELLIWINERY.COM, unique URLs visited within HTTP://WWW.MARTINELLIWINERY.COM, browser type and IP address. Most anonymous data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies. HTTP://WWW.MARTINELLIWINERY.COM web pages use cookies and other technologies for data analysis and personalization services. MVI may place ads on other web sites that may use cookies.
MVI does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and MVI products and services do not target information to children under 13. MVI is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents to take an active role in your child’s online activities and interests.
If you apply to volunteer at MVI, you provide your email address, educational and employment background, and volunteer interest data. You may choose to submit your name when registering or remain anonymous. MVI will not use personal data submitted as part of the volunteer application process for any other purpose.
How we use it
MVI uses your information to help us understand your needs and interests and provide you with better services. Specifically, we use your information to help to communicate with you, to update you on services and events, to personalize promotional offers and to personalize some HTTP://WWW.MARTINELLIWINERY.COM web sites. Occasionally we may also use your information to contact you for market research regarding MVI products or services. We will give you the opportunity to opt-out of market research and customer surveys.
Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide through other sources such as call centers or public events such as trade shows, seminars, or educational events.
Anonymous (non-personal) data is aggregated for reporting about https://WWW.MARTINELLIWINERY.COM web site usability, performance, and effectiveness. It is used to improve the customer experience, usability and site content.
Who we share it with
MVI will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. MVI will not share your personal information with a business partner or any unrelated third party company unless you give your permission. Your permission will be requested when you submit your information.
Choice
You can subscribe to receive information and MVI-wide marketing communications. MVI-wide communications may include new event information, special offers or possibly an invitation to participate in market research. We give you a choice regarding MVI-wide communications by postal mail, email and telephone.
Links provided on https://WWW.MARTINELLIWINERY.COM to third party web sites are provided as a convenience and MVI does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. MVI does not endorse or make any representations about them. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is covered by their privacy policies, not the MVI Privacy Policy. Some third-party companies may choose to share their personal data with MVI; that sharing is governed by that third-party company’s privacy policy.
Onward Transfer
Personal data given to MVI may be transferred across state and country borders for the purposes of data consolidation, storage and simplified customer information management. The practices which govern this data movement are described in our commitments in the Choice and Security sections of this privacy statement.
Access and Accuracy

We will provide you with access to view and change your information, including making every effort to provide you with online access. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. Certain areas of MVI’s web sites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and other personal identifiers.
The most effective way to view and change your personal information is to return to the web page where you originally submitted your data and follow the instructions on that web page or send us a message as described in “Contacting us” below. Data access is also available upon request.

https://WWW.MARTINELLIWINERY.COM does not post third-party ads on our web site. MVI may use third-party media companies to place ads for MVI products or services on other companies’ web sites. If you view a web page where MVI ads appear, the online media company may place a cookie or web beacon on the user’s computer. This allows the online media company to recognize the computer when it is used to return to that site or measure advertising response. This data is anonymous and is not linked to personal data on the user’s computer or any MVI databases. Some MVI newsletters delivered on MVI’s behalf by online media companies use the same technologies. In both cases, this data is also used by the online media company to measure advertising and content interest and relevance. MVI does not have access to the data collected by the online media company. To prevent online media companies from placing cookies on your computer, you will need to visit each media company’s web site and use their cookie removal (opt-out) process.
