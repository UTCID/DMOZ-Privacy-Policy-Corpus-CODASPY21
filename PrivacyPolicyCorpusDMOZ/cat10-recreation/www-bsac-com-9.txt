About Buddyguard
We hope our policy will help implement good practice. It complies with current legislation. Following the guidance should not be onerous and much of what has been included in the policy should be a common-sense approach.
If you have any queries regarding safeguarding issues, contact Mary Tetley directly on 0151 350 6220 or Email
