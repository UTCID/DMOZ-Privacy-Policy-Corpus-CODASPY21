Privacy Policy
Follow the Camino is in compliance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2002 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation of 2018. We aim to take a responsible approach to all areas of our business. In order to process your booking, we need to collect certain personal details from you on the online booking form, or other information forms, such as the names and addresses of party members, credit/debit card or other payment details and special requirements such as those relating to any disability or medical condition which may affect the chosen holiday arrangements. We may, from time to time, need to ask you for more personal information. We may need to pass on your personal details to supplier companies and organisations that we work with (for example your hotel or other trip service providers) on a need-to-know basis, so that your holiday can be catered for as required.
Apart from the exceptions outlined above, we will keep all the personal details that you give us in connection with your holiday absolutely confidential and secure. We do not sell or pass on for marketing purposes any information you give to us. We may, from time to time, contact you with information about One Foot Abroad and/or Follow the Camino, however you will be asked to opt in to receive such communications. If you do not wish to receive any such information, please inform us or click on the Unsubscribe button at the end of our email newsletters. Both One Foot Abroad, Follow the Camino, Flexi-trip and the internet service providers that host our sites, strive to maintain appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you to make your holiday booking.
When you purchase a holiday online you do so through a secure server. The use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology means that all personal information – such as your credit card number – will be encrypted as it travels from your computer to the Company Booking Engine. When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal credit card transaction by telephone. The information will be used to process the full payment 60 days prior to departure, unless advised otherwise.
If you wish to ascertain what information One Foot Abroad and or Follow the Camino holds about you, please email us at info@followthecamino.com
