The Gambrinus Company, a Texas corporation (“Gambrinus”), has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of your personal information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website (the “Site”).
NOTICE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED AND DISCLOSED
This Policy tells you, among other things, what information we gather from you through our Site, how we may use or disclose that information, and our efforts to protect it.
In connection with your use of our website, we may collect the following information:
The domain name, but not the email address of visitors to our website.
The email addresses of users who communicate with us via email.
Aggregate information on what pages our website users access or visit.
Information volunteered by the user, such as site registration, and email update requests.
Information about your transactions with us.
We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law, however, we may choose to disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other similar companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements. Gambrinus and its affiliates whose products are provided through this Site are the owners of the information collected on this Site. Gambrinus may share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties, though such summary information will not identify any specifics related to you. We use the personal identifying information you provide to administer Site usage and monitor traffic-levels, and to contact you regarding improvements we can make to our Site and our services, if necessary. We also may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may use your email address to contact you directly regarding services, products or information that we believe interest you. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.
Gambrinus restricts access to your nonpublic personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide merchandise or information to you. Gambrinus maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
CHOICE/OPT OUT
If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). If you receive communications from us that you do not want to receive, you can opt out from receiving these communications, by deleting your registration profile from our database or specifically telling us to stop sending them to you. If you wish to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties, you may call The Gambrinus Company at the following toll-free number: 1-800-596-6486.
ONWARD TRANSFER (Transfers to Third Parties)
We will apply the Notice and opt out policies discussed above in the event we propose to disclose your information to a third party.
SECURITY
For your security, certain portions of our Site are encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer Protocol (“SSL”) technology on both the client and server end. VeriSign has issued Gambrinus a unique ID, which assures visitors that they have reached our authenticated Site, thereby allowing communications to be encrypted. In order for 128-bit SSL to work, though, you must have a browser that supports SSL technology.
Please note that email may not be encrypted and cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information. Gambrinus will never ask you to submit your financial data, such as your credit card account numbers, via email.
This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card account numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just “surfing.”
While we use 128-bit SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only those individuals and entities who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all parties who receive sensitive information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. We frequently notify and/or remind those parties about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, with access restricted.
Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the ultimate security of any information you transmit.
COLLECTION AND USE OF IP ADDRESSES
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
COOKIES
A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the Site uses to track the pages you’ve visited.
When you register at the Site, Gambrinus uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track information while you are on our Site. Cookies also enable you to enter the Site as a registered user without having to log on each time.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the Site. However, if you turn off cookies, then you may not be able to utilize certain features of the Site.
LINKED SITES
The Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Gambrinus may not be responsible for content or the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
This Site is not directed at children under the age of 21 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 21. If Gambrinus obtains actual knowledge that it has obtained personal information about a child under the age of 21, that information is immediately and permanently deleted from our records.
CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY
We may occasionally change this Privacy Policy. If we do, we will post the changes on the Site. The changes will take effect as soon as posted.
