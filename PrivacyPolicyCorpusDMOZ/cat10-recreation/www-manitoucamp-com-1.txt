Privacy Policy
In order to meet the needs of our campers and have the ability to care for them we must collect personal information about them and their families and distribute some information to people who must care for your child, as staff or as a service provider. All of the information gathered is stored in our files which are secured in our locked offices and processed in a secure data base with appropriate access controls.
We do not sell or rent your family information to any company, organization or individual. Your contract allows us to distribute camper name and contact information only for mailing and communication purposes for other campers and staff. We do retain your information to enable us to communicate with you in the future, provide your camper with recognition for time spent at camp, provide you with information about our programs, do statistical analysis and inform you of new and exciting information that may be of interest to you.
Our Privacy Policy is here to help you understand the way we use the data that you share with us. It covers why we collect certain data, how we collect it and what exactly we collect. It also explains how and who we might share your data with and your rights regarding your data.
