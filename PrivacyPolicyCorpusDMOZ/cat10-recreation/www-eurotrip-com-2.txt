However, aside from our reply to such an email, should you at any time opt-out of receiving further communications we will not send you emails unless you request a particular service that involves email communications or in order to provide customer support in connection with those products. There may be times when you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an email list or electronic newsletter that will send information about our websites to your email address. However, we will provide you with the option to change your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications.

We sometimes engage unaffiliated businesses to assist us in providing you certain services. For example, we may hire a shipping company to help us deliver our products or services to you. We may also use third parties to process online transactions and credit card payments. In those instances, we may need to share your personal information with them. We use these providers based on contractual relationships and require them to use your personal information only to provide the particular product or service and do not authorize them to use your personal information for any other reason.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
IV. Security of Information
The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure your personal information.

You have the right to access your personal information and to limit their use and disclosure.

After receiving a request to change your information, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that all of your personal information stored in databases we actively use to operate our website will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable. However, we reserve the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove from or change in our active website databases. We may retain such information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms of use.
