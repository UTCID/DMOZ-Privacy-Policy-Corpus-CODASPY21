Nissan's Mobility Commitment does not apply to vehicles having collision damage or bodywork repairs carried out (for example, following an accident). Courtesy car must be collected by customer from the Dealership or at the participating Nissan Authorised Repairer at which the service or mechanical repairs are being carried out. Whilst every effort will be made to meet your needs, Nissan cannot guarantee that the availability of courtesy cars or that any courtesy car will be a like-for-like model of your vehicle and we reserve the right to offer alternative methods of keeping you mobile if appropriate.
The provision of a courtesy car is subject to a maximum mileage limit of 100 miles per day. Any excess mileage over 100 miles will be charged at 10p per mile.

Please discuss this direct with our Nissan Dealership or Nissan Authorised Repairer upon collection of the Courtesy car.

CONTINUOUS ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE

At the end of the initial three years, twelve or twenty four months Nissan Roadside Assistance cover as appropriate will be provided following each service in accordance with your vehicle's Warranty Booklet and/or Owner's Manual by a Nissan Dealership or Nissan Authorised Repairer.
For all Nissan vehicles registered prior to 1st October 2010, twelve or twenty four months Nissan Roadside Assistance cover (depending on the model) will be provided following each service of your vehicle (such service being in accordance with your vehicle's Warranty Booklet and/or Owner's Manual) by a Nissan Dealership or Nissan Authorised Repairer.

HERE FOR YOU
Terms and conditions. In the unlikely event that you experience a problem with your Nissan vehicle or the service you have received from one of our Nissan Dealerships or Nissan Authorised Repairer will provide a proposed action plan to resolve your question, concern or query within a maximum of 2 working days.
The action plan will hopefully be the steps to resolve your problem but in a small number of cases it will form the first stage of a process that needs to be completed. For example, stage 1 could be to arrange for your vehicle’s concern to be investigated whilst ensuring your continuing mobility. In the event that an investigation is required, once the results of the investigation are known a full plan of action can be made to resolve the issue.
Our commitment is not a guarantee that the issue will be resolved within 2 working days but it is a commitment to ensure that your question, concern or query is being addressed in a timely fashion. For the avoidance of doubt, our commitment is not an agreement to provide financial support.

However, due to the wide variety of trim levels, bodystyles and other options available, Nissan reserves the right to supply demonstrator vehicles which do not match the precise bodystyle or trim-level of interest.
Test drive promise only applies to newly released models (i.e. models launched and released in the UK less than 90 days before the date of the test drive), and test drives are available from participating dealers.
Test Drives will only be available if you:
• Are aged between 18 and 80 (or between 25 and 80 in respect of the provision of a test drive "sports" car);
