Security Statement
Australian Wine Tour Company have established an online eCommerce system with RealTime payment options. This is undertaken with Verisign.com.au and all online transfer of sensitive details will be via their highly secure website. See below for a brief description of the VeriSign process and their data storage capabilities, or download the Versign Australia’s Public Security policy in PDF format.
Centralised and Secure Data Management
Data is hosted in VeriSign’s high-security, fully redundant, risk-free data center. All transactions between consumers and VeriSign occur over secure SSL connections.
How secure is the VeriSign payment platform?
A critical concern for electronic commerce is the secure transmission of data. To protect consumer data during transmission, VeriSign uses the latest SSL encryption technology that securely passes transaction data to the VeriSign gateway. However, an even bigger security threat to electronic commerce is the storage of sensitive data. To prevent data compromise in the storage server, VeriSign stores sensitive transaction information on secure systems that cannot be accessed through the Internet. Furthermore, VeriSign uses hardware and software firewall technology and additional encryption technology to eliminate all opportunity for intruders to break into a server and compromise information.
