We have the ability to remove objectionable messages and we will make every effort to do so, within a reasonable time frame, if we determine that removal is necessary.

Classic Zcar Club may cooperate with legal authorities and/or third parties in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrong. Violation of this AUP may result in the suspension or termination of either access to the Services and/or Classic Zcar Club account or other actions as detailed below. This AUP should be read in conjunction with our other policies all of which are posted on our website at www.classiczcars.com.

l. Network disruptions and unfriendly activity: Using the Services for any activity which adversely affects the ability of other people or systems to use Classic Zcar Club Services or the Internet. This includes excessive consumption of network or system resources whether intentional or unintentional. This also includes "denial of service" (DoS) attacks against another network host or individual user. Interference with or disruption of other network users, network services or network equipment is prohibited. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that their system is configured, operated, and used in a manner to avoid excessive consumption of network or system resources. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that their system is configured in a secure manner. A user may not, through action or inaction, allow others to use their system for illegal or inappropriate actions. A user may not permit their system, through action or inaction, to be configured in such a way that gives a third party the capability to use their system in an illegal or inappropriate manner.
m. News: Classic Zcar Club users should use their best judgment when posting to any forum. Many forums have charters, published guidelines, FAQs, or "community standards" describing what is and is not considered appropriate. The Classic Zcar Club can be a valuable resource if used properly. The continued posting of off-topic articles is prohibited. Commercial advertisements are off-topic in most forums, especially regional groups not specifically named for such. The presence of such articles in a forum is not indicative of the forum's "intended" use. Please be familiar with basic "netiquette" before posting to a forum.
n. High Volume, Server Hosting, and non-traditional end user activities: The Services are intended for an end user's periodic active use of email, instant messaging, browsing the World Wide Web, and other typical end user activities. High volume data transfers, especially sustained high volume data transfers, are prohibited.  The Classic Zcar Club maintains the right to terminate any user's connection following the detection of any high volume data transfer, server hosting, or non-traditional end user activity as determined by Classic Zcar Club.
