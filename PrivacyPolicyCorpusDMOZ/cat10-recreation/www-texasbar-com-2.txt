Privacy Statement
The goal of Texasbar.com is to provide a rich array of information
and
online tools to State Bar of Texas members and the public. To do this
effectively,
certain user data may be collected and/or reviewed so that we can
understand
our users and in turn make Texasbar.com more and more relevant to each
individual
user. Information about members and the public is used in different
ways,
as outlined below.
This privacy statement may change from time to time as we add features
to
Texasbar.com. If you have questions or comments, please contact John
Sirman
at john.sirman@texasbar.com.
Information Collected and its Use
Information collected from both members and the public
includes:
Server log information: When you visit Texasbar.com or any other
website,
you are identifiable as a unique number, called an IP address. Your IP
address
is automatically collected in server logs. We use this information to
help
diagnose problems with our server and to analyze server traffic to
learn
which pages on Texasbar.com receive more or fewer visitors. This
information
is anonymous and cannot be traced back to a specific individual. The
server
log also can tell us which browser you are using (i.e. Internet
Explorer
or Safari), and the name of the website that referred you to our
site.
(i.e., if you were visiting the Dallas Bar Association website and
clicked
on a link to Texasbar.com, you were "referred" through the Dallas Bar
site).
Cookies: These are text files which our website places on your
computer's
hard drive to keep track of your preferences. We may use cookies to
personalize
your experience on Texasbar.com. That is, cookies may help us remember
who
you are and deliver content and services based on your personal
preferences.
User-supplied information: Current and future services on
Texasbar.com,
may require that you give us your name, email address, or other
personal
information. By providing this information, you can and will be able
to
transact business via the Internet which in the past required
telephone
or mail contact with the State Bar. These online services are provided
as
a convenience to our members, and allow the State Bar to provide you
with
efficient and high-quality service at a lower cost.
Access to some services is protected by a password. We recommend
that you not divulge your password to anyone.
Certain features of TexasBar.com allow attorneys to
request
updates to their membership information, including their address,
telephone
numbers, and email addresses. Attorneys should be aware that certain
member
information, regardless of whether it is submitted via
TexasBar.com,
is subject to the Texas Public Information Act. This act requires the
State
Bar to disclose this information upon request. Because of this
requirement,
this information may be obtained by commercial vendors. Attorneys can
limit
the information they provide to the State Bar Membership Department as
long
as the Bar has at least one address on file so that mandatory
compliance
materials can be mailed to and reach the attorney. An attorney may
choose
not to provide a home address, phone number, fax number, or email
address.
To contact the State Bar Membership Department, email memmail@texasbar.com or call
(800)204-2222, Ext. 1383.
Security
We have security measures in place that are intended to prevent the
loss, misuse, or
alteration
of information under our control.
