It’s sounding like our group will be even bigger because word-of-mouth has caused more interest. Your team made us feel welcome and safe. Kudos to Sean for leading the way...and for plucking me out of the river twice!!!" -  Nancy, Rhode Island "The entire family said this was something they want to do again, and we'll be using this company again to do it. Very family friendly and fun for everyone. " -  Elizabeth, Sept 20 "Thank you for a fabulous weekend! The lodge was super. The raft ride was thrilling! The food after ride was excellent! 5 stars all around! Great job and I hope to make it back up there again." -  Melody, June 2020 "Your staff is always professional, knowledgeable and courteous.
