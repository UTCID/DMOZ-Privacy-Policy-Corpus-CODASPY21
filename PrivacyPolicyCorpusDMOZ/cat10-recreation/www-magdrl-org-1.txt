Privacy Statement The Mid-Atlantic Great Dane Rescue League, Inc. (MAGDRL) is committed to your right to privacy and to keeping your personal information private.
You can visit the MAGDRL web site without telling us who you are or revealing any identifying information about yourself. However, because our web site includes areas in which visitors can provide personally identifying information, we have developed this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and practices regarding information we collect about you.
How We Use Information
Information you voluntarily provide: MAGDRL collects and maintains certain personal information about you when you complete any of our forms such as in downloadable adoption forms; or when you make a donation, subscribe to our newsletter, become a volunteer or member, or send electronic communication to us. Such information may include your name, e-mail address, or mailing address; it may also include the e-mail addresses of those to whom you forward MAGDRL electronic content, and any other information collected in the forms.
MAGDRL adheres to generally accepted Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidance on use limitation which specifies that, “personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for purposes other than those specified in accordance with the “purpose specification” except: (a) with the consent of the data subject; or (b) by the authority of the law.” MAGDRL does not buy, sell, rent or trade our contact or mailing lists.
For MAGDRL web site visitors who do not make purchases or otherwise identify themselves, our web server does not have access to personally identifiable information about you. It does not know your e-mail address unless you volunteer it.

Instead, PayPal collects your name, contact information, credit card or bank information, as well as information about your current purchase. Only your contact information is returned to MAGDRL to enable us to deliver your purchases, to acknowledge your donations, and to respond to questions should the need arise.
We DO NOT share your name or contact information with other companies, nonprofit organizations, or individuals without your expressed permission. MAGDRL may contact you to respond as a result of information you provided to us through our contact web site.
