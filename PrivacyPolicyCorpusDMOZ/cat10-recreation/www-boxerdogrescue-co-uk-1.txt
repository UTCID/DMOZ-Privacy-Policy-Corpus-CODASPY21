General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)Privacy NoticeOur purpose in storing and processing personal data for applicants, fosterers, volunteers and adopters is to protect the health and welfare of the dogs cared for and rehomed through the Charity. We need to be able to communicate with applicants, fosterers, volunteers and adopters as necessary to achieve this.
Our use of the data held is not unethical or unlawful in any way and the impact on the dogs in our care if we were not able to do so would be substantial. It would hinder our ability to provide the necessary care for the dogs and could have a serious impact on their health and welfare.
For the purposes of GDPR we are storing and processing the personal data of applicants, fosterers, volunteers and adopters on the lawful basis of legitimate interests. You have the right to object to this and/or to access your personal data at any time.
