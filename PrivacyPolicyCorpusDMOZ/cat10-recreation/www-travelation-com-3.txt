In addition, passengers are responsible for determining and obtaining proper documentation for travel to international destinations.

COPYRIGHTS/TRADEMARKS
The trademarks, logos and service marks ("Marks") displayed on the Travel Site are the property of Travelation and the Service Providers. All information and content including any software programs available on or through the Travel Site ("Content") is protected by copyright.
GENERAL
These Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of laws provisions. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held or deemed invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
CHARGEBACKS AND CREDIT CARD DISPUTES
If you have any questions regarding a charge on your credit card statement from Travelation.com, please call us or send an email to customerservice@travelerhelpdesk.com before disputing the charge with the credit card company. Travelation.com will work with you in good faith to resolve any issues with you booking per the terms and conditions of the airlines and this agreement. In cases where the customer attempts a chargeback on a non-refundable ticket, processing fee or fare adjustment, for reasons other than fraud, the customer will be responsible for the cost required to initiate legal proceedings in order to recoup the loss to Travelation.com imposed by the customer.
Upon cancellation of the transportation or travel services, where the passenger is not at fault and has not canceled in violation of any terms and conditions previously clearly and conspicuously disclosed and agreed to by the passenger, all sums paid to the seller of travel for services not provided will be promptly paid to the passenger, unless the passenger advises the seller of travel in writing, after cancellation. This provision does not apply where the seller of travel has remitted the payment to another registered wholesale seller of travel or a carrier, without obtaining a refund, and where the wholesaler or provider defaults in providing the agreed-upon transportation or service. In this situation, the seller of travel must provide the passenger with a written statement accompanied by bank records establishing the disbursement of the payment, and if disbursed to a wholesale seller of travel, proof of current registration of that wholesaler.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This transaction is covered by the California Travel Consumer Restitution Fund (TCRF) if the seller of travel was registered and participating in the TCRF at the time of sale and the passenger is located in California at the time of payment. Eligible passengers may file a claim with TCRF if the passenger is owed a refund of more than $50 for transportation or travel services which the seller of travel failed to forward to a proper provider or such money was not refunded to you when required. The maximum amount which may be paid by the TCRF to any one passenger is the total amount paid on behalf of the passenger to the seller of travel, not to exceed $15,000. A claim must be submitted to the TCRF within 12 months after the scheduled completion date of the travel. A claim must include sufficient documentation to prove your claim and a $35 processing fee. Claimants must agree to waive their right to other civil remedies against a registered participating seller of travel for matters arising out of a sale for which you file a TCRF claim. You may request a claim form by writing to: Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation; P.O. Box 6001; Larkspur, CA 94977-6001; or by visiting TCRCs website at: www.tcrcinfo.org.
