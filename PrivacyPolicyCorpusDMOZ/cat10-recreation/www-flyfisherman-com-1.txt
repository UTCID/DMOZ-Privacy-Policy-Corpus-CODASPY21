Dispute Resolution.
Binding Arbitration; Waiver. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits all disputes, controversies and claims arising from or concerning this Agreement, any additional terms, conditions, or policies referenced in this Agreement, your visit, access, registration with or use of the Site, any transactions made on or through the Site, any products or services purchased on, through or in relation to the Site, and/or the Parties’ relationship (whether grounded in contract, tort, statute, law or equity) (collectively, the “Dispute(s)”) to binding arbitration administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (a/k/a JAMS) or its successor (“JAMS”) for the resolution thereof, and such arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving the Disputes. The arbitration shall be binding, final and confidential. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT HE/SHE/IT IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS THE MEMBER OF A CLASS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING.
Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator under the then-current JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”), as supplemented by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence if and where applicable as a gap-filler. If there is any conflict between a provision of the JAMS Rules, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, or this Agreement, then the conflicting provision of this Agreement shall control and govern over the JAMS Rules, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence; and the JAMS Rules shall control and govern over the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence. The construction, interpretation, and enforcement of this section 19 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.
Arbitration Process, Location, and Procedures. The Party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall serve a written notice of arbitration on the other Party in accordance with the JAMS Rules. The arbitration shall be held in Denver, Colorado, United States of America. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the arbitration. All issues or questions concerning either the scope of this arbitration clause or the arbitrability of any of the Disputes shall be referred to and finally decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may construe or interpret, but shall not vary or ignore, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall be bound by applicable law.
Arbitration Decisions and Awards. The arbitrator shall render a written final decision on the subject Dispute as soon as practicable and in any event not more than forty-five (45) days after the close of evidence and briefing. The arbitrator’s decision shall be written, shall be in accordance with applicable law, and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of law setting forth the basis for his/her decision. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, exemplary or consequential damages, unless such an award is authorized by applicable law. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorney fees and expenses if such an award is permitted under this Agreement or applicable law. Subject to any applicable rights of appeal, the final decision of the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive upon all of the Parties who have been served with proper written notice of the arbitration proceeding as required by this section 19. Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed in any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof that is located in the State of Colorado, and may be entered in and enforced by any domestic, foreign, or international court having appropriate subject matter jurisdiction. Any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination of the arbitrator and any information disclosed in the course of any arbitration hereunder shall be kept confidential by the Parties, and any court order to enforce the decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination of the arbitrator shall be filed under seal.
Arbitration Fees and Expenses. JAMS’s administrative and filing fees, the arbitrator’s fees and expenses and all other fees and expenses charged by JAMS and/or the arbitrator to administer or conduct the arbitration shall be shared equally among all parties to the arbitration; provided, however, that the prevailing party of the arbitration may recover an award of its share of such fees and expenses if such an award is permitted under this Agreement or applicable law.
Litigation; Waiver. In the event a particular Dispute is not subject to arbitration (whether by decision of an arbitrator with binding authority, or otherwise according to this Agreement or applicable law), each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state courts of the State of Colorado in Denver County, Colorado, United States of America and the United States federal courts in the District of Colorado, Denver Division, for the litigation of said Dispute, and covenant and agree that neither of the foregoing is an inconvenient venue or forum.
Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Action. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTICULAR DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION, EACH PARTY DOES HEREBY WAIVE HIS/HER/ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, TO PARTICIPATE AS THE MEMBER OF A CLASS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING OR TO NAME UNNAMED MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS.
Notice. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, OSG may give or deliver all other notices to you by means of a general notice posted on this or a similar page of the Site, and shall be deemed effective as of their stated effective dates.
Relationship. In no event shall this Agreement, the performance of a Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Site, any transactions conducted through the Site or a Party’s access of, registration with or use of the Site create any type of fiduciary, franchise, agency, employment, independent contractor, partnership or joint venture relationship between you or OSG.
Miscellaneous.
Electronic Signatures. IF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT IS FURTHER EVIDENCED BY YOUR AFFIRMATIVE ASSENT TO THE SAME (E.G., BY A “CHECK THE BOX” ACKNOWLEDGMENT PROCEDURE), THEN THAT AFFIRMATIVE ASSENT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF YOUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE TO THIS AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, YOUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE IS NOT REQUIRED TO EVIDENCE OR FACILITATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE AND AGREEMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT, AS YOU AGREE THAT THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT AS RELATING TO YOUR ACCEPTANCE AND AGREEMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT ALONE SUFFICES.
Excused Performance. OSG is hereby excused for any failure to perform under this Agreement to the extent that its performance is prevented by any reason outside of its reasonable control or that may be characterized as a force majeure event.
Assignment and Delegation. You shall not assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without OSG’s prior written consent in each instance.
Construction and Interpretation. This Agreement shall be construed to have been drafted by all of the Parties, so that any rule of construction or interpretation that construes or interprets ambiguities against the drafter shall have no force or effect.
Headings. Section headings are inserted in this Agreement for reference and convenience only and shall not interpret, define, limit or describe the scope, intent, terms or conditions of this Agreement.
Severability. If any term or condition of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable by the arbitrator or (if applicable) a court of law with binding authority, then the remaining terms and conditions shall not be affected, and said arbitrator or court of law shall reform the invalidated or unenforceable term or condition to the maximum extent permitted under the law and consistent with the intent of this Agreement.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with those additional terms, conditions, and policies referenced herein and/or made available herein by hyperlink (including, without limitation, the Site’s Privacy Policy), constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; supersedes any prior agreements and understandings, if any, between the Parties with respect to such subject matter; and shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.
