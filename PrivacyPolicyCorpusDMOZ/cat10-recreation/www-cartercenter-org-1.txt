Donor Privacy Statement for The Carter Center, Inc.
This section of the Carter Center's Privacy Statement relates specifically to donors. Read the Center's Website Privacy Statement here.
This statement applies to all donor personal information received by The Carter Center, both online and offline, as well as any electronic, written, or oral communications.
Donor Information
When you make a donation to The Carter Center, Inc. either online, by postal mail or by telephone we collect and store personal information from you such as name, address, daytime telephone number, and email address for the purposes of processing your donation, sending your tax deductible receipt(s) and keeping you informed about how your support is making a difference in the lives of millions of individuals around the world.
We use one or more third party financial institutions to process credit card and electronic funds transfer donations. They receive your credit card and bank information to process these donations in a secure environment, but it is not stored by The Carter Center.
Sharing Your Personal Information The Carter Center, Inc. may use service providers, such as consultants, to carry out certain activities on our behalf. They may be granted access to the personal information necessary to enable them to do their job, but will not use or disclose the information for any other purpose. We also reserve the right to disclose specific information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or to protect the interests or safety of The Carter Center, Inc., our donors, our visitors, or others.
The Carter Center does not rent or exchange active donor personal information (donors who have made a gift in the last 5 years). Occasionally The Carter Center rents its mailing list of inactive donor personal information (no gift in the last 5 years) to other organizations, which allows the Center to raise additional funds in support of Carter Center programs. If you do not wish to participate in the program you can let us know by contacting us at the email or telephone number provided in the Contact Us below.
Communication Preferences The Carter Center contacts donors through direct mail, email, and by telephone.  Any donor may request that the Center remove them from its mailing list and/or specify the method of contact.
Contact Us If you have questions or comments about our donor privacy statement, please send an email to larry.oji@cartercenter.org or call the Center at (404) 420-5109.
Changes to the Privacy Policy The Carter Center, Inc. reserves the right to revise this Privacy Statement. When we do, we will note the last update at the bottom of this page.
