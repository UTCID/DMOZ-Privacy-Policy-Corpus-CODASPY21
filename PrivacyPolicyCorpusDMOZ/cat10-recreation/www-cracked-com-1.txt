or reliability of any opinion, advice, information, or statement made on the Service.
8.2. Right to Resolve Disputes. Cracked has the right but not the obligation to resolve disputes between
users relating to the Service and Cracked's resolution of a particular dispute does not create an obligation
to resolve any other dispute. Cracked's resolution of any dispute is final with respect to the Service.
9.
PROTECTION OF CONTENT
9.1. License by Cracked to You. You must respect the intellectual property laws protecting our Service.

your own personal, noncommercial purposes.

distribute, modify, publicly perform or display, or prepare derivative works of any Content, including any
software, without prior written consent from Cracked or other third-party owner of the rights in that
Content (if any).

ADDITIONAL TERMS
20.1. Agreement to Conduct Transactions Electronically. All of your transactions with or through the
Service may, at our option, be conducted electronically from start to finish. If we decide to proceed
non-electronically, those services will still be governed by the remainder of these Terms unless you enter
into different terms on a form provided by us. If the law allows you to withdraw this consent or if we are
ever required to deal with you non-electronically, we reserve the right to charge or increase fees and you
agree to print or make an electronic copy of the Terms and any other contract or disclosure that we are

the remainder will remain in full effect, provided that the allocation of risks described in these Terms is
given effect to the fullest extent possible.
20.5. Assignment. These Terms are personal to you and you may not transfer, assign or delegate them to
anyone without the express written permission of Cracked. Any attempt by you to assign, transfer or delegate

any policies and guidelines posted to the Service by Cracked comprise the entire agreement (the "Entire
Agreement") between you and Cracked with respect to the use of the Service and supersede all contemporaneous
and prior agreements between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein, and neither party
has relied on any representations made by the other that are not expressly set forth in the Entire
Agreement.
20.10. No Waiver. The failure of any party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms,
including any failure to act with respect to a breach, will not constitute a waiver of such right or
provision or that party's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We suggest that you
print out a copy of these Terms for your records.
