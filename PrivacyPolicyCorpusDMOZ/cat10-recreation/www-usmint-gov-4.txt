1. Acceptable use: You may view, download, and print any material on this Web site that is not subject to copyright or other intellectual property, privacy rights or other legal protections in your jurisdiction, or for which you have a valid fair use claim, provided you may view, download, and print catalog or other written and graphic ordering material on this Web site for noncommercial personal use only.

2. Commercial use: You may not use this Web site for trading, sales or commercial purposes other than for making purchases from the United States Mint.

18 U.S.C. § 709 prohibits a person from knowingly using, without written permission of the Director of the United States Mint, “the words ‘United States Mint’ or ‘U.S. Mint’ or any colorable imitation of such words, in connection with any advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet, or other publication, play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet, or other publication, play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, is approved, endorsed, or authorized by or associated in any manner with, the United States Mint.”
31 U.S.C. § 333 prohibits a person from using, “in connection with, or as a part of, any advertisement, solicitation, business activity, or product, whether alone or with other words, letters, symbols, or emblems [of the Treasury Department, its bureaus, including the United States Mint, and its officials, including United States Mint officials] . . . in a manner which could reasonably be interpreted or construed as conveying the false impression that such advertisement, solicitation, business activity, or product is in any manner approved, endorsed, sponsored, or authorized by, or associated with, the Department of the Treasury or any [Treasury Department bureau or official].”
3. Submissions: By submitting any personally-identifiable information—such as your email address, name, or postal address—you are warranting that you are 18 years of age or older. By submitting any material—including but not limited to suggestions, ideas, and messages (other than your comments on a social media Web site), and artwork—to or through this Web site, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such materials has expressly granted) the United States Mint and its assigns the royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual nonexclusive right and license to use, adapt and modify, incorporate in other works, translate, transmit and distribute worldwide all or part of such material in any form and in or by any medium now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose without compensation (including the right to sublicense). The terms of this section will survive any termination of this agreement.
C.   Text Messaging Services (June 2017)
1. In addition to the email communications we offer, in recognition of the evolving way the public uses technology, the United States Mint is happy to offer certain of its communications services by text messaging. Please regularly check our Web site, along with our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, as the kinds of text messaging services we offer and the terms, conditions and policies governing them may change at any time. We may revise our Terms of Use at any time by posting revisions here and elsewhere on our Web site. When we refer to Messaging Services in these Terms of Use and in our Privacy Policy, we mean those text messaging services the United States Mint is offering at any time and from time to time.
2. When you indicate your choice to receive Messaging Services from us, by sending a message to join Messaging Services, or by otherwise signing up for, using or participating in Messaging Services, you are agreeing to and acknowledging the terms and conditions in this Text Messaging Services section, in addition to the rest of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy that apply to use of our Web site and services generally:

T-Mobile is not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
When you join Messaging Services, we and our contractors collect the information necessary to begin to send you text messages, as indicated in our Privacy Policy.
By continuing to participate in and use Messaging Services, you may be subject to certain additional data collections and uses as set forth in our Privacy Policy. When you make an online purchase from our online store using your mobile device, create an account with our online store using your mobile device, or subscribe to our email newsletters using your mobile device, you are opting in to certain “Tier 3” data collections, tracking and other data uses as set forth in our Privacy Policy, as if you engaged in these activities from your computer. You do not have to make a purchase to receive Messaging Services, and you do not have to subscribe to Messaging Services to make a purchase.
To subscribe to receive United States Mint Messaging Services, text JOIN to 69776. You may text HELP to 69776 at any time for help with our Messaging Services. You may also email us at usmint-support@catalog.usmint.gov or call 1-800-USA-MINT (872-6468).

To cancel your participation in Messaging Services, text STOP to 69776 at any time.

Your participation in the program will then cease and we will send you no further messages.
By joining Messaging Services from a mobile device, you are representing to the United States Mint that you have the right and authority to consent to receive United States Mint text messages to both the mobile device and number from which you have joined. You agree that if and before you disconnect or transfer your mobile device or number, you will take all necessary action (including sending the required STOP messages to the United States Mint) in order to stop future messages from being sent to the transferred device or number.
You may choose to continue to receive email communications from the United States Mint in addition to participating in Messaging Services. The United States Mint will not be responsible for incomplete, lost, late, or misdirected messages, including but not limited to undelivered messages resulting from any filtering by your mobile carrier or service provider, and cannot guarantee that each user will receive the benefit of the Messaging Services for each mobile message sent, that Messaging Services will be available without interruption, or that we will continue to offer Messaging Services. The United States Mint reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel or suspend any or all Messaging Services, in whole or in part.
The United States Mint does not anticipate enabling or permitting two-way text-based communications with subscribers as part of Messaging Services. Nevertheless, use of Messaging Services is subject to all of these Terms of Use, including but not limited to the rules governing acceptable use, content and submissions. For example, by using Messaging Services, you also agree not to transmit, post, or distribute anything that is obscene, libelous, abusive, vulgar, threatening, discourteous or otherwise objectionable; violates any law or rights of any party; or is or contains a virus or other harmful material. Although the United States Mint may or may not regularly monitor or screen messages or their content submitted by subscribers using Messaging Services, the United States Mint reserves the right (but is not obligated) to do so, and to refuse or delete messages or materials in whole or in part, including anything that violates these Terms of Use.
As noted elsewhere in these Terms of Use, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any information provided to Messaging Services users, nothing contained in such information or elsewhere in this Web site or in related materials shall constitute a requirements contract or a guarantee of delivery or availability. Any contract or commitment made to third parties relating to United States Mint products to be acquired or delivered directly or indirectly through Messaging Services is entirely at the Messaging Services user’s own risk.
