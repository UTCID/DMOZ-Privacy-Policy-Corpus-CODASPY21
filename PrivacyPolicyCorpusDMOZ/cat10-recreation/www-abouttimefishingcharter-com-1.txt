Thank you for reading our privacy policy.  Our policy is simple.  We hate spam as much as you do, and we will not be tracking your every move, or capturing your data, or setting cookies in your browser.   We just love to fish and want to share that experience with you.
Our web servers will capture that you someone visited our site so we can see the traffic, but we are not going to be gathering your personal information.  The only information we will capture is if you happen to fill out the form on the right-hand side of the pages.  If you do that, our crew and team will get an email with your contact info, and we will call you to help you plan the best fishing charter ever.   Other than that we will not be sending you endless emails, or calling you constantly to bug you.
We hope to see you soon on one of our trips.
