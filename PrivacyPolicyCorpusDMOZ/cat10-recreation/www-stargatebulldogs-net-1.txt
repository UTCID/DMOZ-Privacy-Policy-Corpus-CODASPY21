Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Stargatebulldogs.net collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Stargatebulldogs.net's purpose in

how Stargatebulldogs.net's visitors use its website. From time to
time, Stargatebulldogs.net may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Stargatebulldogs.net also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Stargatebulldogs.net
blogs/sites. Stargatebulldogs.net only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same

where the comment was left.
