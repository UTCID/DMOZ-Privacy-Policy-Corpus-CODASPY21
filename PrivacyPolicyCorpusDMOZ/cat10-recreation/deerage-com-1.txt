Its Almost Here!
PLEASE be patient with us as we are experiencing unprecedented growth! We are doing our best to keep up with kits and inquiries with our existing system which is not designed for this kind of volume. For fastest response send and email to customerservice@deerage.com. We are so grateful that business is flooding in but with the new system taking longer than expected it is VERY difficult to manage the incoming orders. As always we prioritize sample aging deadlines above all else. If you are trying to get through please hang in there and try email. Thank you!
New system will be in soon! CLICK HERE to see the exciting details
