Introduction
Videos in different forms help your brand to connect with the audience. In present times, the best way to tell a story to your audience is through animation. Animation in the brand’s video content has become effective and affordable.
Here’s how animated videos can help with marketing and making an impact on the viewer.
Makes You Stand Out from Your Competitors
With time, digital marketing is becoming quite competitive. Thus, you have to make sure that you stand out from your competitors with your digital marketing methods. If you use an animated video for your business, you can stand out in the crowd. The viewers will take your brand to be a futuristic, creative, and innovative company.
Increase in Conversion Rates
By using animations, you will not only engage the customers and will also inspire them to buy from you. This will help your business to maximize its profits. Statistics have shown that when you include an animated video on the landing page, it will increase the conversion rate by about 80%.
Whether you are selling your books or clothes, you can market the products through the animated video, no matter how light-hearted or serious the product is.
Conveys Complex Details in a Simple Manner
The most efficacious stories are going to connect with the audience. Hence, if you are unable to connect, your audiences might not be able to understand how your service or product works. Thus, they will not engage with your business. However, using animated videos, you will be able to describe complex ideas in a simple manner. For instance, a technology company can take the help of animation for conveying a complex process or solution. It is the ideal solution to break things down that cannot be explained easily.
Engage with the Customers
These days’ customers tend to engage more with online video content on a regular basis. A recent study shows that 1/3 of the online activity time of internet users are spending watching different videos. Thus, engaging with the customers is important even in this competitive digital marketing world. This can be taken as the first step to making a sale.
Hence, you need content that will give you the opportunity to engage with the customers, effectively. Animated videos are the ideal way to engage with prospective customers as it can provide them with the required information in an interesting manner.
Impress Clients in a Sales Meeting
People will always prefer interesting animated videos in place of a boring slide presentation. If you show animation videos in a meeting, you will be able to get the message across the prospective clients and close the deal successfully. Moreover, when you present an attractive animation at an event or exhibition, you will be able to start conversations with them.
Boost SEO
Just like humans, Google too loves animated video content. If you include animated videos on the website, you will be able to improve your website’s SEO. This will help the business to rank higher on Google search. Thus, your business will be more accessible and visible to prospective clients.
The search rankings of Google’s algorithm also take into account the amount of time that the visitors are spending on the website. This is the primary reason animated videos are seeing growth.
Saves Money and Time
Animations are not going to age as quickly as live-action videos. In a live-action video, the ones that were fashionable even a few years back appear to be dated now. Opting for animation videos is going to save you enough money and time. This is because it is going to appear fresh and doesn’t have to be updated frequently.
An animated video created with the help of Goliath Video production Brisbane will express an idea within a matter of a few minutes which otherwise would have taken several hours to explain. Hence, if you use animated videos, you will be able to save a lot of time.
In comparison to human actors, animation doesn’t promote a certain age, nationality, or race. This is important because the internet is turning out to be a global marketplace. Thus, your brand has to appeal to everyone, irrespective of who they are.
Present Abstract Ideas
One of the primary benefits of using animated videos for your business is you will easily be able to capture ideas. If you want to present something big such as global logistics or abstract such as bitcoin, things can be a little challenging. This is where animated video can prove to be useful. Using an animated video, you will be able to represent ideas that are hard to present on-screen otherwise.
Expand Your Reach
Being a business owner, you will obviously want to reach out to as many customers as possible and provide them with the service or product you offer. Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are popular social media channels that you can use to reach out to innumerable users.
Using an animated video, you can spread the word about your business or the product and services you offer. This will be an interesting and fun way to present it.
Easily Manage Video Production
In case you have ever shot a live video, you will know how complicated and frustrating it can be. You will have to take care of the actors, location, equipment, props, sets, and also the weather. If you have an animated video, there is no need to consider all these factors. You will be able to switch backgrounds, add props, and move characters with just a click of a button. Thus, it makes it easier for you to test various ways of communicating the message.
Promote Brand Development Easily
Animated videos will provide you with the golden chance to integrate color schemes, logos, and brand images in the animated video. It is easy to create a recurrent theme or brand icons using animated videos.
Final Words
Animated videos help in marketing your business effectively. It can promote your business, as well as the products and services that you offer. Make creative videos to reach out to the masses.
