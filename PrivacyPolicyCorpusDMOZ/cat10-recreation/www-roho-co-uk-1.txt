Please note that our website is an online catalogue.  While we maintain a massive stock not every variation shown is available at all times.  To be certain of stock it is best to get in touch prior to purchase.
Making A Purchase
Making a purchase could not be easier. Just browse our store, and add any items that you wish to buy into the shopping cart. After you have finished your selection, click on 'Checkout' and you will be asked for a few details that we need to be able to complete the order.
We accept payment from most debit and credit card providers, including Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, Amex etc.  If you do not wish to pay online via card or PayPal it is possible to call to order on 01924 444888.
When confirmation of your order is received, this is to indicate that we have received your order. It does not indicate that a contract exists between us. If, in error, we have under priced an item, we will not be liable to supply that item to you at the stated price. Your order is an offer to buy from us. Nothing that we do or say will amount to any acceptance of that offer until we actually despatch an item to you. We have included this term to protect us in the case that a mistake has been made in pricing, we have inadvertently under-priced goods, our supplier has altered their pricing, or we are no longer able to supply a particular product for some reason. In the case of a change of price, we will always contact you first to ensure that the price is acceptable.
Please note that our website is an online catalogue.  While we maintain a massive stock not every variation shown is available at all times. Upon receipt of your order our staff will update you via email should any items be unavailable, offering alternatives where possible.
The invoice address you supply on payment must be the address to which the credit card is registerred. If you require a different delivery address to the invoice address, then please specify this when ordering, or contact us to make the necessary arrangements.
Special Conditions for Repair and Service
It is the customers responsibility to contact us regarding the completin date and cost of the repair/service.
All cylinder/regulator repair/service include a parts element which is not included in the labour charge. An estimate of the value of these parts may be given, however, this is not final and a true value will only be available on completion of the work.
Items not collected 90 days after the date on which they were booked in may be sold to recoup costs incurred during the repair/service. We will endeavour to contact you before this happens, however, it remains the responsibility of the customer to collect items within this time period.
We aim to give our customers complete satisfaction so that you continue to shop with us. If you are unhappy with the service you have received, please contact us on 01924 444888 or sales@roho.co.uk and we will endeavour to correct it for you.

If your item is not in stock, we will back order for you. You will always be contacted with the option to cancel your order if you would rather not wait.
Shipping And Handling
All item pricing excludes delivery unless specified. For most items, postage and packing will be added at checkout.  Some bulky items will require a specific delivery quote - please call us for details on 01924 444888. We endeavour to ensure our delivery service is as cost effective and efficient as possible.
We aim for delivery within 3-5 working days via the most approriate method. Non stock items will likely incur delays and our staff will contact you with updates as appropriate.
Free delivery on orders over £100 only applies to mainland UK adresses (excluding Scottish Highlands) and excludes certain large items such as rigid kayaks, which will require quotation.
Delivery Conditions
You must inform us within two working days if the goods are lost in transit so that we can make a prompt claim against the delivery company and correct the problem. Please quote your order number in all correspondence.
For claims related to delivery damage it is imperative that the courier is informed and the proof of delivery signed as such. We would ask you to notify Robin Hood Watersports via email within 24 hours.  Any damage subsequently discovered falls outside our insurance cover.  In circumstances where the parcel is not signed for as damaged you agree that proof of delivery supplied by our delivery company is sufficient evidence to establish that goods have been received and are in good condition.
Returns Policy
You are entitled to cancel your order and return the goods within 30 days for a full refund, excluding delivery charges.
Any goods returned should be in unused saleable condition, complete with original packaging.
Any shortages or damage must be reported within 24 hours of delivery.
Faulty items may be repaired or replaced within the warranty period subject to manufacturer's recommendations.
These terms apply to your order. We may change our terms and conditions at any time, so please do not assume that the same terms will apply in the future.
None of these terms affect your legal rights and these are not diminished in any way. If any term is held to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, that term is automatically omitted from the terms to minimum extent necessary to comply with the law and without affecting the validity or enforceability of the remainder.
Please note that returns are the customers responsibility and are at the customers cost.
