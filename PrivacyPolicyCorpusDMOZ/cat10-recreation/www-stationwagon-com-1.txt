Privacy Policy
Here at stationwagon.com, we intend to give you as much
control as possible over the disclosure and use of your personal information. This means
you can visit this site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about
yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you such as your
name and e-mail address. If so, we will let you know before we collect this information
from you.
Since we do not charge for visiting this site and do not directly engage in
‘e-commerce’, normally the only time we would request personal information from
you is when you request a service from us (for example, posting a ‘wanted’ ad). This
information will help us provide the service, and will help prevent abuse of said service.
If you choose to give us personal information via this site, we intend to let you know
how we will use that information.  If you tell us that you do not wish to have this
information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. We
do (occasionally!) keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this
data for trends and statistics, then discard it.
This site contains links to other Web sites. We of course cannot be responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of these Web sites.
If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, you can contact us
at webmaster@stationwagon.com.
