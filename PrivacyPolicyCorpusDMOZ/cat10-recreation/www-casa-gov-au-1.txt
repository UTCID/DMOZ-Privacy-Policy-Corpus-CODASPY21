Disclosing personal information
Before CASA discloses personal information to a person, CASA will take reasonable steps to verify that persons identity.
If communicating with an authorisation holder, whether by telephone or email, a CASA officer will verify the person’s identity by obtaining their ARN number, current address and date of birth if personal information about the person is proposed to be disclosed – upon provision of this information, CASA will cross reference it against information held by CASA in its licensing database.
If communicating with a member of the public, whether by telephone or email, CASA will verify their identity in some way (for example, if their only contact with CASA was by email, it could be to ask for the email address).
