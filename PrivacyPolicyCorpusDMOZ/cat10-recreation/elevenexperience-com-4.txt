LODGES
Full Experience Properties, Owned and Operated by Eleven Experience
Eleven Experience’s Lodges offer the epitome of experiential travel adventures. At each destination, comfortable lodging and delicious, seasonal food are combined with guided adventures on mountains, in the backcountry, and on the water. No matter how remote, every lodge has custom, impeccably designed accommodations, talented chefs, enticing spas, and world-class guides. Whether heli-skiing near the Arctic Circle in Iceland, or casting for bonefish on a remote flat in the Bahamas, Eleven Experiences are a different kind of escape.

Our carefully curated selection of privately owned residences are available for longer term rentals and comply with all local rental regulations. Eleven Experience has coordinated with a select group of third-party private owners to offer this unique collection of properties that are only available as full home rentals. These properties are unstaffed, and do not include additional guided adventures and culinary services. Although, if you are interested in additional services, we would be happy to help coordinate these for you with local experts.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Procedure
DMCA Complaints
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under United States Copyright Law. If you believe in good faith that Submissions infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Eleven a notice requesting that the Submission(s) be removed from the Site(s), or access to it be blocked. The notice must include the following information:
a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Sites are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity, and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Eleven to locate the Submission(s);
the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party so it may be contacted;
a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the Submission in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and
a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
DMCA Complaints must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. DMCA Complaints concerning materials on Sites should be sent to Eleven’s Designated Agent to receive notification:
C S IRWIN LLC.
ATTN: DMCA Complaint
221 North Hogan
Suite 403
Jacksonville, FL 32202
You may also send the required information by email to info@elevenexperience.com with “DMCA Complaint” in the subject line.
Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that material on a Eleven Site is infringing the copyrights of others. If you are uncertain whether material on a Eleven Site is infringing, Eleven recommends seeking advice of an attorney.
DMCA Counter Notices
If Eleven removes or disables access to content in response to a DMCA Complaint, Eleven will make reasonable attempts to contact the owner of the removed or disabled content, or the owner’s agent. If Eleven removed your material pursuant to another person’s DMCA Complaint and you contend that such material does not infringe upon another’s copyright rights, you may provide Eleven with a counter-notification containing the following details:
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
your name, address and telephone number;
a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for judicial district in which your address is located or, if your address is outside of the USA, for any judicial district in which Eleven may be found and that you will accept service of process from the person who submitted a notice in compliance with the section (c)(1)(C) of the DMCA, as generally described above;
a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material in question; and
your physical or electronic signature.
You must send this notification to the following address:
C S IRWIN LLC.
ATTN: DMCA Complaint
221 North Hogan
Suite 403
Jacksonville, FL 32202
You may also send the required information by email to info@elevenexperience.com with “DMCA Counter Notification” in the subject line.
In addition to the foregoing, the DMCA Counter Notification should contain all of the necessary information required by the DMCA, which can be found at http://www.copyright.gov/.
