Recipient Restrictions & Signing for Shipments
By placing an order for an alcoholic beverage through our website, you formally represent that you are at least 21 years of age and that the intended recipient of the shipment is at least 21 years of age. The recipient will be required to show identification that that proves he or she is at least 21 years old and will be required to sign for the delivery. If the recipient cannot provide identification proving their age or the recipient’s home is vacant, the delivery will be re- attempted three times until the recipient is present and can provide identification. After the third attempt, if no one has been present to sign for the alcohol shipment, the shipment will then be returned to our facilities at the purchasers cost. There is  25% restocking fee for all online returns.
