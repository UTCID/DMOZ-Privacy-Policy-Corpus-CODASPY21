Hidden HelpSANTA YNEZ, CA: A crew of vineyard workers quickly move vine-to-vine to harvest several tons of Sauvignon Blanc grapes near Santa Ynez, California. Harvest is in full swing throughout Wine Country thanks to the thousands of faceless harvest workers that get little attention or public credit for the incredibly hard work they do each vintage. This year they are performing their backbreaking work amidst a pandemic and some of the worst air quality in history. They deserve thanks and appreciation from all wine lovers.INSTRUCTIONS:Download this image by right-clicking on the image and selecting “save link as” or “save target as” and then select the desired location on your computer to save the image.
