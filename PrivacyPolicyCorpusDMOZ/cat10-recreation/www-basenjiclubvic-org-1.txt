Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Those who engage in transactions with Base Info Club are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Base Info Club collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Base Info Club. Base Info Club does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
