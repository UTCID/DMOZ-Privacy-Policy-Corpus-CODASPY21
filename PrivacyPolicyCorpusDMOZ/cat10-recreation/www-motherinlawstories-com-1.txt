Q:  Where can I find poetry on mothers-in-law?
A:  Before we get to the links, please understand, we have to
say the following:
1) We are not endorsing any of the sites.  They simply are sites we
know carry the poems.
2) Please check with each site individually to determine how to obtain legal
copies of the poem without violating copyright laws.
3) This list is not comprehensive - it is simply those of which we are aware.
If you know of others, by all means, please let us know.
Here are the links with PRO MIL poetry.
http://www.melizo.com/holidays/mother/wwwboard/messages/817.htm
http://www.weddingromance.com/poems/poem75.htm
http://www.weddingromance.com/poems/poem8.htm
The last two links are basically the same poem.
Here are the links with ANTI MIL poetry:

Q. Do you have a mailing list?
A. Yes.  On every story entry type page (story entry, story
response entry, help question entry, Dr. Apter Question entry, etc.) we
provide you with the opportunity to provide an e-mail address and sign up
for our mailing list.  Note, you can provide an e-mail and NOT sign
up for our mailing list (in fact, that is the default) if you just want
to allow us the opportunity to communicate directly with you about your
submission (should we have questions).   Please review our Privacy Policy to assure yourself
that we will never share your e-mail address with any third party, and you
can remove your e-mail address from the list at any time.
Top
Q. How does one give a response to any story?
A. Responses can be submitted using the story response link found
beneath each story.   If the response link is not there, the story
has aged sufficiently and responses are no longer being accepted.
Top
Q: I want to respond to one of the printed responses to a story - can
I reply to that reply??
A: We now handle responses via the message board, so any amount of
response activity can be handled.
In the past, we directly managed and posted responses to the same page on
which the story was posted. For those pages, once responses had been accumulated
and published, we were done with that particular page.  If you wish
to respond further, please submit your reply using the new story entry page
(story
entry page).  Please be sure to clearly reference the story/response
you are referring to by mentioning the "signature" line of the
story exactly, as well as the date posted..
Top
Q: When a MIL story is entered, how long before it appears?
A: We do our best to get to stories as soon as possible, and this
is very dependent on the volume of stories submitted.  Our apologies,
but the lag time can occasionally be months.  We have both the pleasures
and the growing pains of rapid growth. We are constantly upgrading
the site (often in ways that cannot be seen) in an effort to make this process
more efficient so we can get to them sooner.
Top
Q: I've waited months and I still do not see my story.  Where is
it?
A: We may not have received it (computer glitch).  Or, if we
did receive it, we may have determined it inappropriate to be posted.
If you feel the material was suitable for posting, please resubmit your
story in an email to us at hereismystory@motherinlawstories.com
and request feedback from us.  If there was a problem, we'll be happy
to explain it to you.  And, thank you for your patience.
Top
Q: You published my story, but there are parts missing.  What happened?
A: There are several possible explanations.  The removed part
may have been offensive.  The part may have been removed to protect
people's anonymity.  Or, it is possible that we did not receive the
missing part.  It is unfortunate, but from time to time a computer
glitch will cause a story to arrive missing a piece of text.  If you
feel the material was suitable for posting, please resubmit your story by
email to hereismystory@motherinlawstories.com
and provide explanation to what was missing.  If you want us to provide
feedback to you, please let us know.
Top
Q: How do I post a Picture?  How do I post a Link?
A: The answer is the same.  First, it must be an appropriate
thing to post (needed for the story, not soliciting, etc.).  Then,
if it is a picture, it must already exist on the internet somewhere that
can be accessed via a URL (web address).  One popular place with our
readers is http://www.photobucket.com
(not an endorsement - just an observation)  Always start the link or
picture URL with "http://".  The software will pick up on
this and know what to do from there.  If you have a very lengthy URL
for a link, please visit http://www.tinyurl.com
and convert the lengthy URL into a tiny one.
Top
Q:  In a lot of the postings I have noticed different symbols such
as :)  What does this mean and is there somewhere I can go to check
out a list of them: if such a thing exists?
A:  These strange keystrokes (sometimes called emoticons) are
meant to display the writer's emotions.  They always require you to
tilt your head 90 degrees to the left (as if you were laying down on your
left side).  As seen from that angle, the keystrokes suddenly make
more sense.  In the particular one you mention, :) , you see a smiling
face (2 eyes and the mouth).  Often, the nose is included so it looks
like this  :-)  The fun part comes when you try to add a flare
of creativity to see just how expressive you can get.  New ones emerge
every day, such as the sly wink  ; )  and the surprise (or
laughter)  :-o .  There are a tremendous number of web sites devoted
to collecting complete listing.  One of the more extensive listings
can be found at http://www.smiliesunlimited.com/
.  On the lighter side (good for a laugh) you may also want to take
a look at Dave Barry's collection at http://www.randomhouse.com/features/davebarry/emoticon.html

Q:  I am having trouble logging in.
A:  First, check the simple things.  Is CAPS LOCK on?
Is something leaning on the keyboard pressing a key?  Are you
sure of your password?  Try requesting a new password - it will be
emailed to the address you registered with us, and you can change it later.
Look at the next question on this page and determine if you have the
correct settings for cookies and java.
Are you using a firewall, or other security?  Be certain that both
of the following addresses are set up as "friendly" sites:
http://www.motherinlawstories.com
http://74.50.2.42
Please be sure this is handled everywhere it must be addressed.  In
Norton, for example, some users had a problem with the Privacy Controls,
not the Firewall.  So, try disabling the Privacy Control.
ONE MORE THING - from the "this just happened to us" files - We
recently found ourselves unable to log on to our own message board.
The culprit?  Our PC has an XP operating system, and, apparently, DS
was playing the Spider Solitaire game under his own login on this same PC.
He managed to switch off the ID at the point that a dialogue box was requesting
an answer whether he wanted to deal again or not.  We fixed everything
by closing him out of that and then rebooting.  Our best guess - this
dialogue box took some sort of lock on a cookies or java related process
that then prevented our cookies or java from operating properly.
So, please make sure that all other IDs that have access to the same PC,
have nothing running.  Easiest way is to simply reboot.  If other
IDs have something running, it will warn you of it.  If so, please
log on to those IDs to be sure whatever is running gets shut down (you cannot
be certain a reboot will take care of it).  Then reboot and try again.
That is what worked for us.
And, finally, as one reader put it, "If it's not that, the very nice
webmasters will walk thru helping you if you e-mail them.  You could
also look at some of the old posts in 'Contact Moderators' and see if the
suggestions help."
