Plans and policies
The University’s Procurement Strategy 2017 - 2020 commits to ensuring sustainability is embedded within the procurement systems within Keele University.
Keele University's Procurement team, with support from staff across the University, have achieved Level 4 of the Government's 'Flexible Framework'. This framework allows organisations to assess, measure and evaluate process and performance against a number of set sustainability criteria.
We’re committed to embedding the processes within the procurement of all public goods, works and services contracts. As part of this process, the procurement team shall facilitate best practice procurement techniques in recognition of the University's overall objective of a sustainable campus. The team is meeting with staff at a senior level to work collaboratively in achieving these objectives.
