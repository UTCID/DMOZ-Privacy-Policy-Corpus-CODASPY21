Welcome to the Boy Scouts of America, Laurel Highlands Council Website.  We know that packs, troops and crews with an active outdoor program attract more young people into Scouting and hold their interest in the program much longer. The Laurel Highlands Council operates a variety of camping facilities and programs.
The Laurel Highlands Council serves Scouting in Allegheny, Beaver, Bedford, Blair, Cambria Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington and parts of Armstrong, Clearfield, Fayette, Huntington, and Westmoreland counties.  We also serve Garrett and Allegany counties in Maryland and Grant, Hardy, Hampshire, and Mineral counties in West Virginia.
