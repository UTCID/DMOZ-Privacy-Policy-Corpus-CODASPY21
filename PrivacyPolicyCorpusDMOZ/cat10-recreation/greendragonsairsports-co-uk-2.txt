Green Dragons Airsports
We are one of the original and best airsports training centres in the UK with the most experienced Chief Flying Instructor and a fantastic team of instructors. We offer a comprehensive range of BHPA approved training courses and fun days to the general public. Whether you want to learn how to fly or just want to taste the sensation of flight, we will have the course or activity day to meet your needs. We teach paragliding, hang gliding and paramotoring on our private flying sites. We are the closest school to London, located at Woldingham within the M25 with easy transport links from central London.
What our Clients say
I did the paragliding fun day and had such an excellent time. It's amazing what you can learn in a day! It's pretty tiring so I do recommend you go in good health (although you can rest whenever you feel like it), but it's so much fun. Sid was a brilliant instructor - just the right mixture of pushing everyone forwards while being caring if anyone had any issues. The tuition was spot on and everyone seemed to get a good amount of attention.
I do feel the communications beforehand could have been a bit better (sometimes I had to chase for confirmation emails etc), but I couldn't bring myself to knock a star off for this as the day was so awesome. Highly recommended!
PS For information, Uber will go there from London. Cuts the journey time massively and probably worth it for the morning at least.
Jessica ElkinParagliding Fun Day
"I bought myself and my wife a paragliding fun day with Green Dragons. We had a brilliantly fun day running around a field and had 3 flights by mid afternoon. The instructors were very patient, knowledgeable and we felt safe throughout the experience. With minimal training and no previous experience we were able to fly solo in under a day. You won't regret giving it a go!"
STEVE HARRISParagliding fun day
"I completed my EP and CP course with Green Dragons. Andy is a great instructor focused on teaching you the skills you require whilst keeping you safe. I would highly recommend training with him because he knows his stuff and his flying sites. Their small private sites mean you fly more and learn faster without the need to wait for others to fly first or navigate busy club sites. Thank you so much!"
JEREMY SLADENParagliding EP & CP Course
"I learnt to hang glide with Andy and had a great time. I live in London so originally picked Green Dragons because it was the closest school. looking back now I am glad i choose to train with them because. They use both hill and winch training so i got to fly days when other schools wouldn't have been able to train. Andy is fantastic with a patient but firm approach to training. Thank you!"

Fantastic day out, had Will as a coach for the day and couldn't have asked for better as really knows his stuff, clear in his coaching style and got me flying in no time. Can't wait to go again.
Chris NormanParagliding Fun Day
I took a paraglider tow conversion course with GD and was very pleased with the experience. As well as being a lot of fun, I was really impressed by the quality of instruction I received. We had a small group (five), but it felt almost like individual tuition because our instructor gave each of us supportive commentary and advice to help us achieve our goals. Good facilities and a great learning environment, backed up by Andy's total commitment, positive attitude, long experience and attention to detail meant that we were all able to get the best out of the time available and maximise our learning. Highly recommended to others!

Paragliding in the UK is always less predictable due to the changing British weather, however, once your airborne the frill of free flight is wonderful and worth the wait.
A little patience is required due to the British weather so if your day is cancelled, then a little para-waiting is required and you need to rebook via email. Email is best to contact the club as if it’s flyable then everyone will be out!
This afternoon, I got in five tow flights! This is a risky sport and safety is paramount. The instructors at Green Dragons will ensure you have fun as well as be safe.
Victor MalpeParagliding Fun day
Hi Andy,
Many thanks for a great day yesterday. I had so much fun but I am now feeling the onset of rigormortis – I haven’t felt this stiff since week one at Sandhurst! Please send my thanks to Oleg, he was very patient!
I will no doubt see you all in about 6 years time when my oldest demands I bring him along for a few lessons – he hasn’t stopped sulking that I didn’t bring him!
All the very best to you all and safe flying!
Fond regards,
Claire Masters

Just wanted to thank Andi for a nice and friendly chat and showing me the site and talking through my options to restart flight again.
cannot wait to get back to the sky.

Best place, best experience and most importantly best coach, Andy Shaw, along with other wonderfully talented professionals in the field with decades of flying time. It is a MUST to go there - truly, you'll love it without question.
Oliver McCourtyHang Glider Fun Day
I bought a tandem paragliding flight as a present for someone and we all had a great time. The Green Dragons team are very friendly and will always seek to get you the best experience, which does involve occasional waiting that can't be helped due to the weather, but is completely worth it in the end. The whole group had a great experience. I was a bystander this time but I think next time I'll be going airborne!
