Product Safety and Recalls
If a product we carry has a safety issue requiring a recall of the product, we notify all customers whom we can identify as having bought the product. This includes members who used their co-op number at the time of purchase, and other customers who bought the product through our website or who otherwise can be identified from purchasing records. We also post notices in our retail stores and on our website.
Current Product Safety Recalls
Please carefully review the details of each product safety recall and follow the recall instructions. If you know other people who have the affected product, please share current recall information with them.
