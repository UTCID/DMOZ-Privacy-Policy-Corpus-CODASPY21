Resume Plus – Author
The basic aim of my resume writing, since last so many years, even before I founded Resume Plus was to assist fresher, job seekers and experienced professionals to sail through first job recruitment hurdle, and get shortlisted for the interview. The charm of watching individuals move a step forward for the interview call, and then recruited in the job through your resume is like accomplishing a noble deed in life. It is also a thrilling experience to find the resumes written by you really kicked start the professional career of the applicant.
