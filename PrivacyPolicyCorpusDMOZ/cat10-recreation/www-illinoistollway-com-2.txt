The Illinois State Toll Highway Authority Privacy Notice
Last Updated: Friday, May 22, 2009
PREAMBLE
Pursuant to the fundamental philosophy of the American constitutional form of government, it is declared to be the public policy of the State of Illinois that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them as public officials and public employees. The access to this information is not intended to be used to violate individual privacy, nor to further a commercial enterprise, nor to disrupt the duly-undertaken work of any public body independent of the fulfillment of any of rights of the people to access to information.
PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CHOICE
"Personal information" is information about an individual that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes personal identifiers such as an individual's name, address, phone number, drivers license number and social security number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information. We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (e.g., sending an email, setting up an I-PASS account or participating in a survey). If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the Illinois Tollway Web site. If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, State law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.
WEB LOGS
The Illinois Tollway analyzes our website logs to continually improve the value of the materials available on our site. Our website logs are not personally identifiable. When a visitor requests a page from any of our Web sites, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our Sites. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate and we do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not automatically record email addresses of the visitors.
CORRESPONDENCE
If during your visit to the Illinois Tollway website you participate in a survey or send an email, the following additional information will be collected: 1. Email correspondence: The email address and contents of the email. We may use your email to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our Web site, or to forward the email to another agency for appropriate action. 2. Surveys : Any information you volunteered in response to a survey. Survey information is used for the purpose designated. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats that you have provided.
COOKIES
