Welcome to
Marshall Volkswagen
Volkswagen Retailers in Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Essex, Devon, Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire & SomersetMarshall Volkswagen is one of the leading Retailers in the UK, operating from 15 locations in the south, west, central and north-east of England.
We’re established on a firm foundation of delivering consistently high levels of customer care which are underpinned by our Six Pillars of Service. These values are instilled in our team across all of the showrooms, so you can always expect to receive the same helpfulness and attention at every visit, wherever you are.
Our showrooms are a welcoming and relaxed place to search for a new car. Most of the latest models are on show with a variety to explore, ranging from the iconic Golf to the bold Tiguan and the popular Polo and T-Roc. We also have hybrids and 100 percent electric Golfs on offer and our experts can explain how they work.
If you’re in the market for an Approved Used car, you’ll find a wide range on our forecourt, all of which have been selected for their low mileage and excellent condition.
While we aim to ensure that you’re able to browse at your own pace, we always have experts on hand to help. They can guide you through the range, explaining the different features, specifications and trim levels, as well as the customisation options.
To help you drive the Volkswagen that you want, we have a number of finance options available. We can tailor them to suit your budget, so your new car is much more affordable, and we’ll make sure everything is set up for you.
Once you’ve driven away in your new purchase, we’ll make sure that you feel fully supported with car maintenance. All of your Volkswagen’s servicing, MOTs and repairs can be taken care of at our showrooms. Specialist technicians, who are all trained by Volkswagen, will work on your car using the latest diagnostic and repair tools. If your car need a replacement part, we’ll make sure it’s ordered directly from Volkswagen. We know that having your car serviced or repaired can be a stressful experience at times, which is why we offer free courtesy cars.
We’re always here to help, so contact us by phone, online or via email, or call into your nearest showroom to speak to one of the team.
