Returns & Cancellations
CANCELLED ORDERS
If you cancel your order after it has been sent to our fulfillment center, a 25% restocking fee will be applied before a refund is issued. Please send an email to customerservice@robertmondaviwinery.com if you need to cancel your order. Once the wine has been received at our warehouse, we will refund your credit card account for the cost of the wine less shipping, handling, and the 25% restocking fee.
DAMAGED OR FLAWED WINES
Robert Mondavi Winery guarantees quality products and service. Your satisfaction is our first priority. We will replace or refund your cost for any bottle of wine that is damaged or flawed that was purchased through our website. Wines purchased through retailers must be returned to them. We ask that you return the unfinished portion of the original bottle for replacement. By law, we cannot accept returns of alcoholic beverages unless the products are corked or flawed. We are also unable to accept return of wine that was damaged due to adverse weather conditions during shipment, or wine that is ordered in error. Weather damage may include leakage, freezing, and/or corks pushing. Please be sure to check shipping destination weather conditions before placing your order.
To arrange for the return of corked or flawed products, please send an email to customerservice@robertmondaviwinery.com.
If the original shipment was damaged or flawed, you will receive a full refund, including shipping and handling charges, or you will receive a full replacement order.
DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
Federal law requires a signature be obtained from an individual over the age of 21 for all wine shipments. Notes with a signature, left for the delivery companies, cannot be accepted as a replacement for an individual signing for the shipment. We recommend that orders be shipped to a business address for prompt delivery. We cannot guarantee the condition of any wine if delivery is not made on the first delivery attempt. Orders that are not delivered on the initial attempt may be held in a facility that is not temperature controlled.
