We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors. This policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.

This privacy notice explains the type of information collected; how it will be used; whether it will be disclosed to third parties and the use of cookies.
Adventure Balloons Ltd websites contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties and these websites will have their own privacy notices and Adventure Balloons Ltd encourage users to review them. Adventure Balloons Ltd does not accept any responsibility or liability for the practices of such third-party websites and users should read carefully their privacy statements.

This Section sets out our data retention policies and procedure, which are designed to help ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of personal information.
