3. Cookie Law
Also known as the 'Cookie Directive', the instrument that defines the requirements for consent for cookies across the EU is Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, an excerpt of which is reproduced below:
“Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information”.
The UK introduced the amendments on 25 May 2011 through The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011. The relevant section is below:
6. (1) Subject to paragraph (4), a person shall not store or gain information, or to gain access to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.
(2) The requirements are that the subscriber or user of that terminal equipment -
(a) is provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and
(b) has given his or her consent.
(3) Where an electronic communications network is used by the same person to store or access information in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user on more than one occasion, it is sufficient for the purposes of this regulation that the requirements of paragraph (2) are met in respect of the initial use.
(3A) For the purposes of paragraph (2), consent may be signified by a subscriber who amends or sets controls on the internet browser which the subscriber uses or by using another application or programme to signify consent.”
In summary, to comply with the law, we need to give clear information about what the cookies are used for, why, and obtain consent from you, the user. These are the objectives this Policy is set out to achieve.
4.Types of cookies and purpose
Cookies can be categorised in many ways, one is with regards to their longevity, i.e. for how long they are stored in your browser. According to this classification, cookies can either be:
- Session cookies: temporary cookies that identify and track users within our website. These are automatically deleted by your browser when you close your browser or end the session; and
- Persistent cookies: cookies which enable our website to ‘remember’ who you are and your preferences within our website. These cookies are stored in your browser (the specific location depends on the browser and version) for a period of time.
We assess the cookies present in our website periodically, to ensure they are aligned with the requirements of current legislation. For instance, we remove persistent cookies set to hold data for an excessive period of time, which do not meet the principle of storage limitation, as per Article 5.1.e of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
