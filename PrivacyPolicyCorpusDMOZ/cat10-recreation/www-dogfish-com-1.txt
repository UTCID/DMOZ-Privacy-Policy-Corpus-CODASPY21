Dogfish Head Companies and its affiliates are committed to respecting your privacy. We believe in a culture of choice for our customers and visitors to this website. We want you to have control over your data and information, and to feel that your right to privacy is being respected.

We therefore will collect information – as detailed below – that we feel we need to provide you with the best possible Dogfish experience. We promise to simultaneously remain transparent about our collection practices, and to provide conspicuous and easy-to-use opt-out processes wherever feasible. We also promise to use industry standard practices to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access.
The Privacy Policy detailed below comprehensively explains how we collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process information through Dogfish’s websites in the United States. In addition, this policy states how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We commit to not using or sharing your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
We urge you to read this Privacy Statement so that you understand our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment.
Cheers!
The Dogfish Team

Information Collected Automatically. Dogfish may also collect Technical Information about you when you visit our websites, which your web browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website on the Internet.

Our servers automatically record this information, which may include your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. Gathering your information helps us ensure our websites and other services work correctly and support our customer analytic efforts.
Email communication. We use pixel tags and cookies in our marketing emails so that we can track your interaction with those messages, such as when you open the email or click a URL link that’s embedded within them. When recipients click on one of those URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on a company website. We use tools like pixel tags and cookies so that we can determine interest in particular topics and measure and improve the effectiveness of our communications.
Mobile communication. When you download or use our mobile-device applications, or access one of our mobile-optimized websites, we may receive information about your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device.
Cookies and Similar Technologies. We may collect information about your use of our websites through cookies and similar technology.

For example, we may use these technologies to collect information about the ways you use our websites, to support the features and functionality of our websites, and to personalize your experience when you use our websites. Dogfish uses cookies to operate and improve our website as well as to simplify our interactions with you. When you visit our websites, our servers send a cookie to your computer or mobile device to help personalize your experience.

Information Collected from Third Parties.Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and other widgets that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the organization providing it. For example, if you create or log into your account through a third-party social networking site, we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site. Dogfish may also collect information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our services to you, and prevent or detect fraud. We work closely with third parties (for example, business partners, service providers, sub-contractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, fraud protection services) in an effort to constantly improve our products and services, and may receive information about you from them.
Co-branding. Some of our websites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you use such websites or services, both Dogfish and the other company may receive the Personal Information that’s collected via that co-branded website or service.

We partner with third parties to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your browsing activity. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
Log Files. Log files record website activity on our services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits.

We may use this information throughout Dogfish for the purpose of employment consideration. We will keep the information for future consideration unless you direct us not to do so.
Promotional Messaging or Advertising. Dogfish uses your contact information to recommend products and services that might be of interest to you, to send you marketing and advertising messages such as newsletters, announcements, or special offers or to notify you about our upcoming events. We also use your contact information to contact you about any sweepstakes or contest you may have entered.
Ability to Opt-Out of Promotional Messaging or Advertising
Because we value your privacy and choice in how your information is handled, Dogfish is happy to help you opt out of receiving advertisements based on your interests, called targeted advertising. Unfortunately, due to the nature of websites, even if you optout of Internet-based advertising, you will still receive advertisements but we will make sure they not be targeted advertisements. To opt out of targeted advertisements, visit www.dogfish.com/opt-out.
Dogfish also allows you to opt-out of receiving communications, such as mailings or text message marketing. You may opt out of receiving marketing-related postal mailing or prevent text message marketing by visiting www.dogfish.com/opt-out.

We will, however, use your information for the limited purpose of alerting you should you win a contest or sweepstakes.
Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties
Disclosure for Business Purposes. Dogfish will never give your Personal Information to others except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose Personal Information to third-party vendors and service providers that work with Dogfish, but only where necessary to help us provide a product or service to you. Examples of third parties we work with are call center operators, shippers, servicers, information processors, and financial institutions. These third parties only have access to personal information necessary for them to complete their service. We may also disclose and transfer your Personal Information in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
Disclosure of Personal Information for Legal and Safety Reasons. Dogfish may be required to disclose personal information to the authorities, including law enforcement agencies, government agencies, or legal entities. We may also disclose information where required by law, litigation, or as a matter of national security to:
comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law;
in the event of an emergency that threatens an individual's life, health, or security; or
to the extent permitted by applicable law in special cases in which we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate, identify, or take preventive measures or bring legal action against someone who may commit or cause harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct, such as a threat of harm to you or anyone else, interference with our rights or property, or interference with U.S. homeland or national security or public safety anywhere in the world.
Disclosure by Third Party Websites. Using our website or services may link you to third party web websites, services, and applications. Dogfish is not responsible for any Personal Information collected through these means. Information collected is governed through the third party's website's Privacy Policy because any interactions you have with these web websites, services, or applications are beyond the control of Dogfish. When you post information to or through such services, those websites' privacy policies and cookie usage policies apply directly. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of any external websites before providing any Personal Information while accessing those websites so that you can make an informed decision regarding the use of your Personal Information.

Security Measures
Taken to Protect Personal Information by Company. Security of all information is of the utmost importance for Dogfish. We use technical and physical safeguards to protect the security of your personal information from unauthorized disclosure. We use SSL encryption methods to keep all information secure. We also make all attempts to ensure that only necessary people and third parties have access to Personal Information. Nevertheless, such security measures cannot prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Information and we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law. Where required under law, we will notify you of any such loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Information that may affect you so that you can take the appropriate actions for the due protection of your rights. Dogfish also reviews its security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.
To Protect Personal Information by Third Parties. We require that our third party service providers and channel partners agree to keep all confidential information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in the agreements we have in place with them. These third party service providers and channel partners are expected to maintain privacy and security protections that are consistent with Dogfish’s privacy and information security policies. While we provide these third parties with no more information than is necessary to perform the function for which we engaged them, any information that you provide to these third parties independently is subject to their respective privacy policies and practices.
Data Retention and Storage
Dogfish retains your information for business purposes, for as long as your account is active, and/or as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with our products and services. Dogfish will also retain your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a reasonable period of time.
Unfortunately, however, no system or online transmission of data is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our services. To that end, Dogfish will notify users of a data breach when Dogfish determines that is reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable law. Any transmission is at your own risk and Dogfish expects that you will use appropriate security measures to protect your information.
Choice: Your Privacy Rights
Dogfish gives you choices about the ways we collect, use, and share your Personal Information. You can choose what contact and financial information will be stored in your account and preferences. However, if you choose not to provide certain details, some of your experiences with us may be affected.
If you would like to know what Personal Information we hold about you, you may submit a request to us by using the web form available at www.dogfish.com/opt-out. We will supply Personal Information about you that we hold in our own files within the reasonable timeframes stipulated by law.
Promotional Offers from Dogfish.If you do not wish to have your e-mail address/contact information used by the company to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt-out by using one of the methods described above in 'Use of Collected Personal Information: Ability to Opt-Out'.
Targeted Advertising. If you do not want us to use information that we collect or that you provide to us to deliver advertisements according to our advertisers' target-audience preferences, you can opt-out by using one of the methods described above in 'Use of Collected Personal Information: Ability to Opt-Out'.
Mobile services. Some of our mobile services use your device's location information. You can adjust the settings of your mobile device at any time to control whether your device communicates this location information. We may also offer additional controls on our use of your mobile location information.
Access to and Correction of Personal Information.
Dogfish provides you many opportunities to access and update your personal information. You can ensure that any account, contact, or financial information is up-to-date and can correct, update or delete inaccuracies to the information by logging into your Off-centered Society account, or you login to the Dogfish website. If you are having trouble updating this information, you may also email info@dogfish.com for help.
Dogfish will attempt to answer all requests that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete it as long as Dogfish is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. In some jurisdictions, in addition to you agreeing to this Privacy Policy, data privacy laws may require us to obtain a separate consent before we send you information that you have not specifically requested. In certain circumstances, your consent may be implied (e.g. where communications are required in order to fulfil your requests and/or where you have volunteered information for use by us). In other cases, we may seek your consent expressly in accordance with applicable laws.
In addition, to protect your privacy, we will require you to prove your identity before granting access to, or agreeing to update, correct or delete your Personal Information and we will only implement requests with respect to Personal Information about you (not anyone else).
Collection of Information from Children.
Dogfish doesn’t sell or advertise to minors or children, and recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy and safety of children. Therefore, our website and services are directed towards the general audience and are not directed towards children. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 21 or minors otherwise defined in local law or regulation without verifiable parental consent. If we learn that someone under 21 has provided Personal Information through one of our websites, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our databases.
