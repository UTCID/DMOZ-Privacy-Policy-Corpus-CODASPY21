Dispute Resolution
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED BELOW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EITHER PARTY MAY ELECT TO RESOLVE BY BINDING ARBITRATION ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, DISPUTE OR DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND US, WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT (ANY “CLAIM”). THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, DISPUTE OR DISAGREEMENT ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE INTERPRETATION, EXECUTION, ADMINISTRATION, AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION OF THIS AGREEMENT; (2) ANY SERVICE ACCOUNT; (3) ANY CHARGE OR COST INCURRED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT; (4) THE COLLECTION OF ANY AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SERVICE ACCOUNT; (5) ANY ALLEGED CONTRACT OR TORT ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY SERVICE ACCOUNT, ANY TRANSACTION, ANY ADVERTISEMENT OR SOLICITATION, OR YOUR BUSINESS, INTERACTION OR RELATIONSHIP WITH US; (6) ANY BREACH OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT; (7) ANY STATEMENTS OR REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY SERVICE ACCOUNT, ANY TRANSACTION, ANY ADVERTISEMENT OR SOLICITATION, OR YOUR BUSINESS, INTERACTION OR RELATIONSHIP WITH US; OR (8) ANY OF THE FOREGOING ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO ANY AGREEMENT WHICH RELATES TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY SERVICE ACCOUNT, ANY TRANSACTION OR YOUR BUSINESS, INTERACTION OR RELATIONSHIP WITH US. IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, THE CLAIM SHALL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (“FAA”).
This agreement to arbitrate shall include any Claim involving our officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, contractors, subcontractors, parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, any third party that assigned any agreements to us and any of the respective employees, officers, agents or directors of such affiliates or third parties, and any such Claim against any of those parties may be joined or consolidated with any related Claim against us in a single arbitration proceeding. In addition, if we become a party in any lawsuit that you have with any third party, whether through intervention by us or by motion made by you or any third party, we may elect to have all claims in that lawsuit between you and such third party to be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION under this agreement.
The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and its Supplementary Procedures For The Resolution Of Consumer-Related Disputes (the “Arbitration Rules”) in effect at the time the demand for arbitration is filed. In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control, except that, in the event that the AAA determines that any provision of this Agreement does not comply with applicable standards stated in the AAA’s Consumer Due Process Protocol, the standards of the Protocol shall control. We will tell you how to contact the AAA and how to get a copy of the Arbitration Rules without cost if you ask us in writing to do so. Or, you may contact the AAA directly at 1-800-778-7879 (toll free) or at www.adr.org.
If the AAA’s Supplemental Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes apply to your Claim and if your Claim for actual damages does not exceed $10,000, you shall be responsible for paying one-half of the arbitrator’s fees up to a maximum of $125. If your Claim for actual damages exceeds $10,000 but does not exceed $75,000, you shall be responsible for paying one-half of the arbitrator’s fees up to a maximum of $375. For any Claim that does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all other arbitrator’s fees and costs imposed by the administrator of the arbitration.
If your Claim is a consumer-related claim for actual damages that exceeds $75,000, or if it is a non-monetary consumer-related Claim, or if it is not a consumer-related Claim, you shall be responsible for paying the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees as provided in the AAA’s Commercial Fee Schedule. Additionally, in the case of a consumer-related Claim for actual damages in excess of $75,000 or for non-monetary damages, and in the case of any non-consumer-related Claim, the prevailing party in an arbitration proceeding may seek to recover its expenses for administrative fees and arbitrator(s)’ fees from the other party in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. The final award by the arbitrator(s) pertaining to such a Claim can apportion the administrative fees and expenses and arbitrators’ fees between you and us as part of the award, as the arbitrator(s) determines is appropriate.
The fees and costs stated in this Agreement are subject to any amendments to the Arbitration Rules and fee and cost schedules of the AAA. The fee and costs schedule in effect at the time you submit your Claim shall apply. The Arbitration Rules permit you to request a deferral or reduction of the administrative fees of arbitration if paying them would cause you extreme hardship. Each party also has the option of filing an action in small claims court for any Claim or disputes within the scope of the small claims court’s jurisdiction.
The arbitration of any Claim of $100,000 or greater shall be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators. The arbitration of any Claim of a lesser amount shall be conducted by one arbitrator. The arbitrator(s) shall be selected from the AAA’s panel of arbitrators by mutual agreement between you and us. If we cannot agree on the arbitrator(s), the AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s). EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, NO CLAIM MAY BE JOINED WITH ANOTHER DISPUTE OR LAWSUIT, OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ARBITRATION OF ANOTHER CLAIM, OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS, OR BROUGHT AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ON ANOTHER SIMILAR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. All statutes of limitation, defenses, and attorney-client and other privileges that would apply in a court proceeding shall apply in the arbitration. Any in-person arbitration hearing will be held in the federal judicial district for the Middle District of Florida.
Any dispute regarding whether a particular controversy is subject to arbitration, including any claim of unconscionability and any dispute over the scope or validity of this agreement to arbitrate disputes or of this entire Agreement, shall be decided by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall establish such reasonable procedures as may be necessary for the reasonable exchange of information between the parties prior to such arbitration. In rendering an award, the arbitrator(s) shall apply applicable contract terms, statutes and legal precedent and shall follow the Federal Rules of Evidence, enforce applicable privileges, and employ applicable burdens of proof.
The arbitrator(s) shall award only such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could properly award under applicable law. The arbitrator’s findings, reasoning, decision, and award shall be set forth in writing and shall be based upon and be consistent with the law of the jurisdiction that applies to the Agreement. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
In the event that the arbitration results in an award which imposes an injunction on you or on us, or contains a monetary award in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), the award shall be reviewable on appeal initiated within 30 days of the award by a panel of three new arbitrators selected to hear the appeal under the procedure for appointment from the national roster as provided by Commercial Arbitration Rule 11. Such review shall apply the substantive and procedural standards normally applying to an appeal of a judgment from a trial court of competent jurisdiction. However, if the award does not impose an injunction on you or on us or contain a money award in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), then the award shall not be appealable and shall only be subject to such challenges as would otherwise be permissible under the FAA.
This agreement to arbitrate does not limit the right of you or us, whether before, during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding, to exercise self-help remedies such as set-off, repossession, trustee’s sales and the like. This agreement to arbitrate does not limit the right of you or us, whether before or during the pendency of any arbitration proceeding to bring an action (individually, and not on behalf of a class) to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies or injunctive relief (other than a stay of arbitration) to protect the rights or property of the party seeking such relief. However, the arbitrator(s) shall have the power to vacate and/or stay any such proceedings or orders granting provisional or ancillary remedies or injunctive relief, upon application by you or us. The taking by either you or us of any of the self-help remedies or by filing any action in court, including but not limited to the actions described in the preceding sentence, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to elect BINDING ARBITRATION of any Claim upon the filing of a counterclaim or the like by either you or us in response to any such action.
You and we specifically acknowledge and agree that this Agreement evidences a “transaction involving commerce” under the FAA, and hereby waive and relinquish any right to claim otherwise.
Should the AAA be unavailable, unable or unwilling to accept and administer the arbitration of any Claim, or any appellate proceeding, as applicable, or otherwise refuse or decline to accept and administer the arbitration of any Claim, or any appellate proceeding, as applicable – in whole or in part and for any reason whatsoever – this agreement to arbitrate shall not fail or be invalidated as a result. Rather, in that instance, any party to the Claim may then petition a court of competent jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. § 5 to appoint the arbitrator(s). Upon consideration of such a 9 U.S.C. § 5 petition, should the court decline or refuse to appoint the arbitrator(s), then and only then and within 30-days of a final and non-appealable decision on the matter from such court, you and we shall each respectively pick one arbitrator, and those two arbitrators shall then, by mutual agreement and within 30-days of the selection of the second of them, select a third arbitrator. The third arbitrator so selected shall then arbitrate the Claim as the sole arbitrator, except with respect to a Claim for $100,000 or greater, in which case all three arbitrators so selected shall arbitrate the claim together, with the award and all pre-award decisions made by majority vote. In the case of any arbitration not administered by the AAA, the arbitrator(s) shall still be bound by all applicable provisions of this agreement to arbitrate and the Federal Arbitration Act. They further shall administer and conduct the arbitration under the Arbitration Rules, to the extent such rules may be practicably applied to an arbitration not administered by the AAA.
If any term or provision of this agreement to arbitrate any and all disputes, and waiver of jury trial, is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be enforced without regard to the invalid or unenforceable term or provision; provided, that if you or we seek to bring a joined, consolidated, or class action for arbitration, and if the foregoing prohibition against the arbitration of joined, consolidated or class actions is held by an authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the arbitration agreement between you and us shall be deemed inapplicable to such joined, consolidated or class action, to the effect that any permitted and lawful joined, consolidated or class action shall be adjudicated in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and shall not be resolved through arbitration (provided further, that the jury trial waiver shall, in any event, remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law). This agreement to arbitrate any and all disputes, and waiver of jury trial, shall survive the termination of services under this agreement and/or the closing of your Service Account(s) and shall also survive as to any Claim covered within the scope of this Agreement.
WHETHER ANY CONTROVERSY IS ARBITRATED OR SETTLED BY A COURT, YOU AND WE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO SUCH CONTROVERSY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
Forum and Venue. You agree that you will resolve any Claim you have with us relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with these Terms, us, the Site, or the Owlcam Services (each, a “Dispute,” and together, “Disputes”) exclusively in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in Pinellas County, Florida.  You hereby consent to said courts’ personal jurisdiction over you and waive any defense, whether asserted by motion or pleading, that Pinellas County, Florida is an improper or inconvenient venue.  This is intended to be mandatory, and not a permissive, forum selection provision.  Provided, however, nothing in this section shall prevent a party from enforcing a judgment it obtains against the other party in any other jurisdiction.
Governing Law. The laws of the State of Florida govern these Terms, as well as any Disputes, including, but not limited to, non-contractual disputes or claims, which might arise between Owlcam and you, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND WE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
Limitation on Time to File Claims.  ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

What Personal Information About Users Do We Gather?
In order to help us personalize and continually improve your experience at the Site, we gather certain types of information. The types of information we gather are:
Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you provide when you use the Site, when you use our products, or when you give to us information in any other way. For example, we collect information to track users’ location and to download video feeds from our products.  Also, we may request that you provide certain personal information, including your name, address, email address, birth date, telephone number, contact information, and any other information from which your identity is confirmed. We may also sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral, and preferential and/or lifestyle information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy and Data Policy. In other areas, we collect or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination of the two types of information. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of certain features or products related to the Owlcam Services. We use the information that you provide to us for such purposes as providing services to you, providing products to you, responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our services, and communicating with you.
You also may choose to share:
account information, such as your profile name, phone number, and photo, which may be available to other parties using our services, if you elect to share that information, although you can configure your settings through the Site to manage certain information available to other users. You may provide your mobile phone number and/or email address to create an recovery account through the Site and for other features and services. You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile name, profile picture, email address, and status message.
your contacts, including users with whom you communicate and who may store or share your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Site. We receive information other people provide us, which may include information about you. For example, when other users you know use our services, they may provide your phone number from their mobile address book (just as you may provide theirs), or they may send you a message, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. You may at some point provide us the phone numbers in your mobile address book, including those of both the users of our services and your other contacts, for sharing your videos. You confirm that you are authorized to provide us such information. To help you organize how you communicate with others, we may create a favorites list of your contacts for you, aggregated from information you provide, and you may be permitted to create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information.
your messages to us and to other through the Site. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 10 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we may delete it. To improve performance and deliver media messages more efficiently, such as when many people are sharing a popular photo or video, we may retain that content on our servers for a longer period of time.
information related to your use of the Owlcam Services, including copies of your messages, and how to contact you so we can provide you customer support. For example, you may send us an email with information relating to our Site performance or other issues.
