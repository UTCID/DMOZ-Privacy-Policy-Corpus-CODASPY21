Please do not be conned into buying an expensive spinone cross or an unregistered Spinone puppy. Price does not equal quality, in fact it is the opposite in the Spinone. You are being ripped off. Read our articles below. You can expect to pay around £1,000 to £1,400 for a well bred, health tested puppy from a responsible breeder. Email "puppies@italianspinone.co.uk" to contact our Puppy Register for more information. Click on this message to visit our new puppy website.
