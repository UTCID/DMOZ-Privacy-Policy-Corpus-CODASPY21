Payments are always non-refundable, even under these circumstances.A 20% deposit per booking is required to reserve your trip. This deposit is non-refundable under all circumstances because we begin to spend this money on your behalf right away.Full payment is due 60 days before your program’s start date. This payment is non-refundable under all circumstances. No cancellations, group-size changes, or date-changes are allowed after this date.Date-change requests are subject to availability and cost $50 per booking. Date-changes are not allowed within 60 days of your program’s start date, and your new date must be within the same calendar year. We adhere to these policies under all circumstances, and therefore we recommend that you purchase trip/travel insurance or wait to register until closer to your desired date.Private Group Registration:If you plan to schedule a private group climb, the Group Leader will be responsible for all deposits and payments for the entire group. Each individual must still complete our Registration Form. We require younger climbers (under 16 years) to join us in a private setting.Inclement Weather:Challenging weather conditions are often a part of climbing in the mountains. Timberline Mountain Guides will lead your climb in any weather conditions, although there is no guarantee that we will reach the summit. Once a trip begins, there are no refunds or date-changes available due to bad weather.Regardless of the forecasted weather, we are unable to offer refunds, exchanges or rainchecks in the weeks or days before a scheduled trip.We will uphold our cancellation policies in all cases.Turning around without reaching the summit:The guide will make a decision to turn back if they feel that the group is being placed in jeopardy. We are not in a position to evaluate your fitness level. Our guides can only make decisions based on the speed and coordination of the team relative to current conditions and forecasted weather. If you have any chronic health conditions, please consult your doctor before signing up for any trip.Climber-to-Guide Ratios:Each climbing program has a maximum climber-to-guide ratio, listed at the bottom of the climb description. These ratios are determined based on the hazard exposure and the limitations of protection systems that we employ. For that reason, our guides will not exceed this ratio in technical terrain, and climbers in open group programs can be turned around to maintain the maximum climber-to-guide ratio of 3:1 for those continuing climbing. Private Guides are available for anyone concerned about climbing with unknown partners.Acknowledgement of Risk Forms:At the start of your program you will be asked to sign an Acknowledgement of Risk form. We recommend that you take the time to read this form prior to arriving, and we invite you to call our office in advance if you have any questions about it.Climbing and mountaineering involve inherent risks  – many that we can manage to a degree – some that are beyond our control. By signing, you assume responsibility for all the risks associated with this activity, and you acknowledge the hazards that are beyond our control. We do not assume liability for injuries or death. All participants are completely responsible for all medical and hospital costs associated with any injury, rescue or evacuation. You go at your own risk.Snowcat Transportation:We partner with the Timberline Lodge to provide snowcat transportation on our Summit Program. This machine is a great resource for bypassing the lower flanks of the mountain however, due to the extreme weather and snow conditions that we experience on Mount Hood, there is no guarantee that it will be able to access any particular location or elevation. We do not offer refunds, nor will we reschedule programs in relation to the snowcat’s ability to travel in the conditions presented. Climbs will depart from the lodge at the planned time, with or without snowcat transportation. AboutAbout Timberline Our Guides Contact Us AMGA Accreditation Community PartnersResourcesEquipment Lists Rental Gear Policies Private Rates Travel Insurance Fitness Requirements Frequently Asked QuestionsAsk a QuestionName Email* QuestionPrivacy*
