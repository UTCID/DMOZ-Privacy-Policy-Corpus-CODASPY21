Privacy Policy
Metro
Marine Modelers Privacy Policy
This
policy is to advise members and others providing personal information to the
MMM what will happen to that information. Typically, the information collected
includes name, contact information, address, year of birth, particulars of
boats owned and event related information such as enrollments and standings.
The information will be used for club purposes, that is, to organize and promote club activities and events, and for recruiting. The club may share membership lists and contact information with its members to promote communications between members. To give other examples, some information, such as regatta results or participation in exhibitions may be published. Other information, such as the age of members, is required by the City of Toronto from all groups applying for permits to use City property,  in our case the pond at Humber Park East (the city wants to encourage the use of its facilities by senior citizens). Our insurer and our co-insured may also require information. Members’ personal information is not provided to sponsors or to outside organizations not involved in our activities.
Information
will be kept indefinitely. Members may ask the treasurer to verify and correct
the information the club has about them at any time. Former members may ask
that personal information be deleted from club records.
