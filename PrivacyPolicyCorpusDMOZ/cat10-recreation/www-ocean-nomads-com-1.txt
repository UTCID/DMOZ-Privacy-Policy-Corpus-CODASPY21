The ‘Agent’ shall mean any entity who is booking a client to travel through the company.

The “client” shall mean any person or users of any product or service sold or provided by the company.
The client warrants to the company that he/she is authorized to make the booking and in doing so, therefore, accepts all the conditions below on behalf of himself/herself and each of his/her traveling companions including any minors who may be accompanying him /her.
CONTRACT
All bookings taken by the company are subject to these standard terms and conditions.
All company product, packages, services or tickets purchased by a client, are supplied by a supplier. The supplier is solely responsible for the design and supply of the products bought by the client. The company only assists in the booking of such products and shall provide all necessary travel documents for the client to purchase the product. Therefore the contract for the products lies between the client and the supplier. Each supplier will have its terms and conditions relating to the products purchased.
The specific terms and conditions of the suppliers can be obtained from the supplier on request. The company has no contractual liability to the client in respect of the product bought from the company.
QUOTATIONS AND AVAILABILITY
A quotation is an offer to provide travel services and is subject to price increases. An agreement is only concluded once the full product price is paid for in full.
The prices of all products are subject to change and may only be confirmed when paid for in full. Please note that quotes provided are subject to availability. The price quoted can never be guaranteed, and all products, including but not limited to airfares and tour operators travel packages, are subject to change without notice and before payment in full. Any increases must be borne and paid by the client upon demand.
Quotes are based on standard special agreements with certain suppliers, and these offers may be subject to availability/occupation, etc. which is not known at the time of the quote; this may affect the ultimate tour price, should these offers not be available at the time of the booking. We will, however, endeavor to secure the booking based on the quoted offer.
On acceptance of a quotation, any subsequent changes to the quoted itinerary will attract an additional charge per change, irrespective if payment to secure the booking is made or not.
PAYMENTS
A booking request will be valid for 24 hours unless otherwise stated. The deposit must be paid, and it is the client’s responsibility to request and read the specific suppliers booking terms and conditions.
No person, organization or employee of the company has authority to vary these booking conditions; and the company reserves the right to decline any booking.
A minimum 50% non-refundable deposit is required within this period to guarantee the reservation. This deposit will only be refunded if the booking cannot be accommodated. Until this payment has been made, the reservation cannot be guaranteed. This may vary depending on the individual supplier booking terms and conditions that are part of the proposed product.
The full balance due is payable 40 days before travel date. If the full amount is not received in due time, the company reserves the right to treat the booking as a cancellation.
We also insist that the client settles their flight fare and flight taxes with the deposit.
The company business is conducted on a cash basis and travel documents, shall not be prepared until full payment is made. If paying by cash, please ensure that you receive a company invoice.
Credit Cards are acceptable; however please note that a surcharge will be added and that certain suppliers do not accept credit card payments.
CANCELLATIONS
Any cancellations made by a client must be in writing. Any amendment or any change by a client to a reservation in whatsoever manner (date change, rerouting, etc.) after payment constitutes a cancellation. If the client cancels a reservation for whatever reason, the company shall charge an administration fee, and the supplier may well also impose a cancellation fee, which could be up to 100% of the product price.
Airline refunds will often take a minimum of 11 (eleven) weeks to process.
Please note cancellation fees will be levied in the event of cancellation as per the Reservation Terms and Conditions
Should cancellation be received before 40 days before travel, a 50% cancellation fee will be charged.
Should cancellation be received 39 days before arrival date, a 100 % cancellation fee will be charged.
CHANGES AND ALTERATIONS
The company does not guarantee the safety standards or performance of any supplier. The clients of any product purchased through the company accept that the use of the product may be dependent on certain factors beyond the company’s control and therefore agree that the company will not be held liable for any compensation to the client if it is forced to cancel or in any way change the booking or any flight or transfer due inter alia, but not exclusively, to force majeure including war, riot, civil strife, industrial dispute, terrorist activity, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, adverse weather conditions or other external circumstances beyond the control of the company.
The company reserves the right to cancel the booking without prior notification and in such an event only agrees to refund all monies already paid and received by the client. Unforeseen cancellations due to war, unrest or any other force majeure or other circumstances are still subject to the supplier’s cancellation and bookings terms and do not constitute a valid reason for waiver of any supplier cancellation policy terms. If the client changes any travel arrangements such as, but not limited to accommodation, activities, flights transfers or any portion of the agreed itinerary, the company shall not be held liable for any compensation or costs to the client whatsoever.
FLIGHT SCHEDULES AND TRANSFERS
The company bases its flight schedules according to the information available to the company and published by the airline. Such flight schedules are subject to change with no notice. Also, many inter-property transfers or flights are coordinated amongst some properties or charter companies. The rate quoted for flights are based on schedules that are often only confirmed to the company on the day of travel, and therefore clients must understand and accept that changes in flight schedules or transfer times could occur and very occasionally in the event of delays or factors out of the company’s control, an unscheduled overnight stay could be required. In the event of any of these changes or situations, the company will not be held liable for any costs what so ever, and any costs incurred such as but not limited to additional charters, accommodation, meals, communication costs, etc. must be settled directly to the third party establishments by the client.
INSURANCE
Travel and cancellation insurance, to include cover for water-based activities/scuba diving and snorkeling is recommended for all clients. All insurance is solely the responsibility of the client. Before a client commences with travel, he or she should arrange his/her insurance with a reputable insurer, with protection for the full duration of the stay or itinerary, to cover personal injury, medical expenses, repatriation expenses, loss of luggage and expenses associated with the cancellation or curtailment of any booking. If a client becomes ill, all hospital expenses, doctor’s fees, and repatriation costs are for the client’s account, and the company, shall not be liable for any refund of the booking whatsoever. The carriage and storage of all baggage and personal effects are at all times the client’s risk, and the company cannot accept any liability for any loss or damage of baggage or personal effects.

Any failure to declare may result in cancellation of his /her booking.
CLAIMS AND COMPLAINTS

If the client has any further complaint, then they must lodge this in writing to the company within 10 (ten) days of the booking end. If these procedures are not followed then the company will not investigate or continue to investigate such complaints.
