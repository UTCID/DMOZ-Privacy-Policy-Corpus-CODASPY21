Client Contact Information and Emails
Our site uses registration forms for customers to register
personal and property information. We collect visitor's contact
information (like their email address, and telephone). Contact
information from the registration form is used to send newsletters
and information about our company to our advertisers and to
allow visitors to get in contact with advertises. The advertiser's
contact information is also used to get in touch with the
advertiser when necessary. Email information is not passed
on directly to any other interested party and can not be extracted
from our site by web crawling software thus protecting your
email address being collected by junk mailing lists.

Telephone Numbers
Telephone numbers are only used to contact the advertiser
in the event of questions arising due to unexpected problems.
No unsolicited or cold calls will be made by us. Telephone
numbers will not be passed on to any other parties except
other advertisers where you have explicitly given permission
for this to happen.
