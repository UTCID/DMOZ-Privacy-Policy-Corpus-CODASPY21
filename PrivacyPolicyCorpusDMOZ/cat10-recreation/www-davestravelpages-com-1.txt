Your privacy is important to me, because I value my own privacy as well! As such, I've kept to a minimum the type of data this website registers, and take all steps to ensure that the data is protected.Let me start by saying what I WON'T sell your data to third parties – That's just weird!This privacy policy was recently updated to be in compliance with the new GDPR regulations in Europe. These have been designed to offer citizens of Europe protection from their personal data being exploited. I'm in total agreement with this, and have taken every step to be in compliance with the regulations. What happens when you visit the siteYour ConsentAdvertsing – After May 25th 2018, visitors to the site from the EU will see a popup asking if they agree to personalised ads served by my advertising partner MediaVine. These ads are likely to be based on your previous browsing experience. You are free to opt in and out as you wish. I collect no data myself from this. Check out the Mediavine specific policy at the end of this post.Why do I have the ads? This website is a business, and a business needs to make money – I'm sure you understand! Newsletter – You may see an option to sign up for various newsletters on the site. You can not be automatically signed up for a newsletter, and I have a double-opt in process so you can't be ‘accidentally' signed up either! It goes without saying that I would need your email details in order to communicate with you. These are stored in my third party service provider who is currently Mailchimp. I only use this for communication with yourself based on the reasons you signed up, and you are free to unsubscribe at any time – there is a link included in each email to do so. Concerned? Don't sign up !Comments – If you decide to leave a comment on the blog, you will be asked for a name and email address. This is so you can be notified of any replies to your comment, and is a key usability feature. Your IP address will also be stored in order to combat spam. I believe this is covered by legitimate interest as the concept of communication, community, and commenting can not function with out this. Concerned? Simply don't leave a comment.CookiesThe website needs to use cookies to function and as part of legitimate business operations. These can be first party cookies as well as third party cookies. These cookies contain no data that I can use to identify you, but are instead designed to help your browsing experience. Internet users have always had full control of the cookies on their computers, and you can access this through your browser settings. I have no way of either tracking the cookies left on your computer or using them to identify you. Analytics – This website uses analytics so that I can further improve my service. I use these to see which pages are the most visited, how I can improve content, and whether my visitors come from search or social media. I have set the ‘Anonymity' feature for the analytics. This means that the last few digits of the IP address are masked from both myself and Google. No one can identify you!Links to external websites – Dave's Travel Pages links to external websites where I think they will provide extra value for you, or as an affiliate as part of my legitimate business. Each site you visit should have its own privacy statement, which I encourage you to read! I have no control over the data they monitor when you visit them. From my end, I will see that someone has clicked through, but I have no way of personally identifying who it was – As it should be! Put SimplyThe short version, is that there are only two occasions in which your personal data is stored by myself – either when you sign up for a newsletter or when you leave a comment. In both circumstances, you have to take proactive steps in which to do so willingly. If I use this data at all, it is only for the purpose it was designed for. I regularly look over data I may have, and erase those things that are no longer needed in full compliance with GDPR.Accessing your informationIf you are still concerned, and would like to access any information you believe I may have or request it be deleted, please contact me directly at – dave@davestravelpages.com. We'll have a chat and sort it out!Mediavine Programmatic AdvertisingThe Website uses Mediavine to manage all third-party advertising on the Website.
