Identity Theft - Phishing Alert
Identity theft can be committed by e-mail or via other means, such as regular mail, fax or telephone, or even by going through someone's trash. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another genuine person’s personal or professional information such as their name, email address, professional designation or other identifying information without their permission to commit fraud or other illegal activity.
Internet fraudsters and scam artists are increasingly targeting unsuspecting people by a method called PHISHING. Phishing is when you receive an authentic-looking email which purports to come from an official source or reputable business, but in reality is sent by criminals from a similar looking email address and which encourages you to provide personal or financial information. This information can be used for fraudulent purposes or to carry out illegal activity.
How to protect yourself from phishing

Jumeirah's official communications are never sent from personal email addresses hosted on public domains such as yahoo, hotmail or gmail. If you are suspicious, please verify the sender email address carefully.
Other than email confirmations sent from an official Jumeirah email address (@jumeirah.com) for bookings made via our website (www.jumeirah.com), Jumeirah does not conduct or approve financial transactions over email.
