Types of Information We Collect:
Generally, you are free to browse the visitor areas of TheDieselPage.com web site without submitting any personal information. We do not collect any of your personal information (such as a name, address or email address) when you visit the TheDieselPage.com site unless you register for the TheDieselPage.com forum, submit the membership application, complete one of our surveys, or otherwise agree to share such information with us. As part of such processes, you have the opportunity to decline further notifications from us regarding special offers and/or information from TheDieselPage.com. Types of information collected by the TheDieselPage.com web site are described below in more detail.
TheDieselPage.com Bulletin Board Registration:
Bulletin Board registration is required for users who wish to interactively participate in the TheDieselPage.com bulletin board and mailing list. In order to register, you must provide us with a username (which does not have to be your real name), password and a valid e-mail address. This allows us to protect our community from abusive postings, and provides a verifiable point of contact should legal questions arise. As currently configured, your e-mail address will remain hidden from other users when registering for and using TheDieselPage.com's bulletin board forum.
However, accessing all areas of our free bulletin board forum or accessing the member/subscriber areas of the web site requires registration.
For your own protection, we recommend that you select a unique login name and password for our Bulletin Board forum. Using the same code set for multiple Internet venues can put you at risk, especially if that code set is also used to access an email account or online financial service.
When you register for the forum, you have the option of providing additional information, such as occupation, interests, and homepage URL. This optional information is viewable by other TheDieselPage.com users, and helps to foster a sense of community. If you have any concerns about providing this information, simply leave the fields blank.
Your forum registration will be processed without this additional information.
Our Bulletin Board administrators and moderators cannot review all messages posted and are not responsible for the content of any of messages posted by others. If you feel a message posted by another is improper, please make an administrator or moderator aware of your concern. The Bulletin Board administrators and moderators reserve the right to delete or edit any posted message for any reason whatsoever if that message violates our Bulletin Board forum guidelines or is otherwise deemed inappropriate. You are an invited guest into our bulletin board forum home.
It is important for you to know that when you provide personal information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a message posted on our or any Bulletin Board or online classified ad, that this information is available to anyone who has access to TheDieselPage.com web site,
or bulletin board forum, and may be used by someone in a manner unintended by you. For your own protection, we discourage you from offering any personally identifying information within a posted message to this or any other online discussion group.
