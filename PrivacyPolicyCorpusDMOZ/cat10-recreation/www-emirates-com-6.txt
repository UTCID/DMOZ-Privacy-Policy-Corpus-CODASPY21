Cookies allow a website owner to distinguish the activities carried out from your device from other users of that website.

To protect your privacy, your browser permits a website to access only cookies it has sent to you and not cookies sent to you by other websites.Our platforms use different types of cookies. Session cookies exist just for the current session on our Platform and persistent cookies exist for a period of time after your visit. First-party cookies are cookies set by our Platforms and third-party cookies are set by third-party platforms. We utilize both session and persistent cookies and both first- and third-party cookies.We also use cookies for different purposes. For example, we use some cookies to provide a seamless experience when you use our loyalty programs or complete a booking, or where you don't complete a booking (so we can inform you of this and provide assistance); we use other cookies to improve our use of advertising to make it more relevant to you. To assist you, we've provided a more detailed explanation of the types of cookies we use below, categorized by the purpose of the cookies.Essential Cookies - These cookies are essential for the operation of our Platforms. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log in to secure areas of our websites, complete a booking, or make use of other online services we provide. They also include cookies that help us understand how users use our website, allowing us to improve the overall experience without being able to identify or target you or any other user individually. If you disable these cookies, you may not be able to use our platforms fully or at all.Functional cookies – These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Platforms. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, provide your Skywards details if you are registered, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region), and identify to us when you don't complete a booking so we can inform you of this and offer assistance.Marketing cookies - These cookies record your visit to our websites, the pages you have visited and actions you have taken. We use this information to make our advertising displayed on other platforms (by third-party advertising providers) more relevant to you.

We also use third-party cookies so we can personalize our advertisements to you and to help us analyze our customers' behavior. Our third-party advertising providers set anonymous cookies on other websites that we advertise on. If you receive one of those cookies, we may then use it to identify you as having visited that site if you later visit our Platforms. We then personalize our advertisements to you based on this information.Current browsers allow you to change your cookie settings.

These files are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that function similarly to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear images are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails. We may use clear images (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags) in connection with the platforms to, among other things, track the activities of platform visitors, help manage content, and compile statistics about usage of the platforms. We and our third-party service providers also use clear images in HTML e-mails to our customers to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.We use aggregated statistics provided by third-party digital platforms about your interaction with us across multiple devices, such as your laptop and mobile, based on your log-ins into different services offered by these third parties. These statistics help us understand your journey across different devices and allow us to personalize the look and feel of our Platforms. These third parties also allow us to personalize our advertisements to you on your various devices on the basis of your behavior on one or more of your devices when you have logged into the relevant third parties’ services. We use other aggregated data provided by third-party digital platforms, including demographic information (such as age and gender) and information about your interests (such as travel and shopping) derived from your other website usage, together with our own aggregated data about your interactions with us on our Platforms; these data are used to help us understand user behavior so that we can improve our Platforms, products, and services. We do not disaggregate this data to identify your specific demographic or interest information.You may opt out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). For more information and available choices for third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI)(Opens external link in a new tab) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA)(Opens external link in a new tab). Opting out of these networks does not otherwise limit the collection of personal information described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy. Understand that you will still see online ads even if you opt out. Opting out only means that members of ad networks you have opted out of will no longer deliver targeted content to you. You may continue to see interest-based advertisements from other parties from whom you have not opted out, or from companies that have not adopted the self-regulatory standards for online behavioral advertising that we follow. You will also continue to receive generic ads that are not targeted based on your visits to multiple websites.This site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
