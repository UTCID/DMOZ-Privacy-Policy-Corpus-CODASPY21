Home Privacy Policy Privacy Policy
We take your privacy seriously. We do not share, trade or sell any of your personal data with any organization beyond what is necessary to process your order. All orders are placed via a secure internet connection. Because this is a family owned and operated business, when we receive your order, your information is handled by the owners – not a call center or warehouse staff. We strive to take every step possible to protect your personal data at all stages of our order process. We value your privacy as if it were our own!
