SAAMI Legal & Legislative Affairs Committee
The SAAMI Legal and Legislative Affairs Committee is responsible for tracking developments at the state and federal level in the field of product liability law and legislation that impact the design, manufacture and sale of firearms, ammunition and propellants by SAAMI member companies.
The Legal and Legislative Affairs Committee actively represents our members’ interests in Washington, D.C., before Congress, the Executive Branch, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation – National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and other federal regulatory agencies.
The Legal and Legislative Affairs Committee also focuses closely on state legislative proposals. For example, the Committee played a leading role recently in defeating several California bills – bullet serialization and firearms micro-stamping — that, while well-intentioned, were neither realistic nor workable. Had these bills passed, they would have had disastrous consequence for law enforcement, citizens and SAAMI member companies alike.
The Committee is proactive, too, working to advance legislation consistent with SAAMI’s mission. For example, the Committee worked together with a strong coalition of business groups, shooting sports organizations and the conservation community to win passage in Congress of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms, a law that blocks “junk” lawsuits that would blame firearm manufacturers for the actions of criminals.
