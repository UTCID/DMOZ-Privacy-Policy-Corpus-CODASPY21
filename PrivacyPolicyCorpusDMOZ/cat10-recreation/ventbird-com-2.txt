IF VENT BREACHES OR OTHERWISE VIOLATES THIS AGREEMENT, THEN YOU SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO SEEK OR OBTAIN, AND YOU DO HEREBY WAIVE, ANY TYPE OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST THE SITE AND/OR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE ON, THROUGH, OR IN RELATION TO THE SITE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SERVICES) AS A RESULT OF SUCH BREACH OR OTHER VIOLATION. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE FOREGOING LIMITATION ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF DOES NOT LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO SEEK OR RECOVER ANY MONETARY REMEDIES AUTHORIZED BY LAW IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH BREACH OR OTHER VIOLATION (EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHICH ARE OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PRECLUDED BY THIS AGREEMENT); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY SUCH NON-PRECLUDED CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MONETARY REMEDIES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM ACCRUES, OR ELSE SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

that cannot be limited or altered under applicable law.

subsidiaries, and other affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, managers, owners, partners, agents, employees, representatives,

privileges granted or conveyed by you under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the User Materials).
You also hereby waive any rights you may have under Section 1542 of the
California Civil Code and any other statute or common law principle of
similar effect, which provides: “A general release does not extend to
claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to
exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that,
if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor or released party”.

not be liable or responsible, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or

hereby excused for any failure to perform under this Agreement to the
extent that its performance is prevented by any reason outside of its
reasonable control or that may be characterized as a force majeure event.

Governing Law. This
Agreement, the additional terms, conditions, and policies referenced
herein (including the Site's Privacy Policy and Refund Policy), your
access or use of the Site or any Services, your registration with the
Site, any transactions made on, through, or in relation to the Site, any
products or services purchased on, through, or in relation to the Site
(including, without limitation, the Services), the Parties' relationship,
and all disputes, controversies, and claims arising from or in connection
with any of the foregoing (whether grounded in contract, tort, statute,
law, or equity) will be governed by and construed under the laws of the
State of Texas and the applicable federal laws of the United States of
America, regardless of its place of execution, its place of performance,
and any conflicts of law analysis.
Dispute Resolution.
Mediation; Binding Arbitration; Waiver. Each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that all disputes,
controversies and claims arising from or concerning this Agreement,
any additional terms, conditions or policies referenced in this
Agreement (including the Site's Privacy Policy and Refund Policy),
your access or use of the Site or the Services, any transactions
made on, through, or in relation to the Site, any products or
services purchased on, through, or in relation to the Site
(including, without limitation, the Services), and/or the Parties'
relationship (whether grounded in contract, tort, statute, law, or
equity) (collectively, the "Claim(s)"), will first
be submitted in good faith by the Parties to nonbinding mediation in
Travis County, Texas. If the Claim is not settled at mediation, the
Claim will be submitted, at the sole discretion of VENT, its agents,
servants, employees, shareholders, officers, directors, attorneys,
contractors and subcontractors, past, present, and future, and their
respective heirs, legal and personal representatives, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "VENT-Parties"), to
arbitration in Austin, Travis County, Texas, administered by
Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. or its successor
("JAMS") in accordance with the (i) then-current
JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (the
"JAMS Rules") and (ii) laws of the state of Texas.
No waiver of this agreement to arbitrate will be enforceable on the
parties. If the VENT-Parties do not elect to have a Claim submitted
to arbitration, exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any suit based
upon a claim otherwise subject to arbitration under this agreement
will be in Travis County, Texas. Even after suit is filed, the
VENT-Parties will have the right to submit the case to arbitration
by motion filed within 120 days after service of process, summons,
citation or statement of claim on the VENT-Parties. The Parties
agree and stipulate that this agreement to arbitrate, including each
related agreement and transaction, is involved in interstate
commerce. This agreement to mediate, arbitrate, or submit Claims to
court does not waive or modify the release and indemnity contained
in this Agreement.
Binding Arbitration.
Arbitration Process and Procedures. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.
The arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the JAMS
Rules, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the
arbitration. All issues or questions concerning either the
scope of this arbitration clause or the arbitrability of any
of the Claims shall be referred to and finally decided by the
arbitrator. The arbitrator may construe or interpret, but
shall not vary or ignore, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and shall be bound by applicable law.
Arbitration Decisions and Awards. The arbitrator shall render a written final decision on the
subject Claim as soon as practicable and, in any event, not
more than forty-five (45) calendar days after the close of
evidence and briefing. The arbitrator's decision shall be
written, shall be in accordance with applicable law, and shall
be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of
law setting forth the basis for his/her decision. The
arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive,
exemplary, or consequential damages, unless such an award is
authorized by applicable law. The arbitrator shall have the
authority to award attorney fees and expenses if such an award
is permitted under this Agreement or applicable law. Subject
to any applicable rights of appeal, the final decision of the
arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive upon all of the
Parties who have been served with proper written notice of the
arbitration proceeding as required by this Section 23.
Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered by a court in Travis County, Texas having jurisdiction
thereof. Any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award, or
other determination of the arbitrator and any information
disclosed in the course of any arbitration hereunder shall be
kept confidential by the Parties, and any court order to
enforce the decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award, or
other determination of the arbitrator shall be filed under
seal.
Arbitration Fees and Expenses. JAMS's administrative and filing fees, the arbitrator's
fees and expenses and all other fees and expenses charged by
JAMS and/or the arbitrator to administer or conduct the
arbitration shall be shared equally among all parties to the
arbitration; provided, that the prevailing party of
the arbitration may recover an award of its share of such fees
and expenses if such an award is permitted under this
Agreement or applicable law.
Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Action. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT HE/SHE/IT IS
WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS THE
MEMBER OF A CLASS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING.
Litigation; Waiver.
In the event a particular Claim is not subject to arbitration
(whether by decision of an arbitrator with binding authority, or
otherwise according to this Agreement or applicable law), each Party
hereby irrevocably submits to exclusive personal jurisdiction and
venue in Travis County, Texas and the United States federal courts
in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, for the
litigation of said Claim, and covenant and agree that neither of the
foregoing is an inconvenient venue or forum.
Notice. Unless otherwise
expressly stated in this Agreement, VENT may give or deliver all other
notices to you by means of a general notice posted on this or another page
of the Site, as applicable, or by email to your email address as you may
provide to VENT on or through the Site, and such notices shall be deemed
effective as of their stated effective dates.
Relationship. In no event
shall this Agreement, the performance of a Party's rights or obligations
under this Agreement, the Site, or a Party's access or use of the Site or
the Services create any type of fiduciary, franchise, agency, employment,
independent contractor, partnership, or joint venture relationship between
you and VENT.
Miscellaneous.
Electronic Signatures. IF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT IS FURTHER EVIDENCED BY YOUR AFFIRMATIVE ASSENT TO THE SAME (E.G., BY A “CHECK THE BOX” ACKNOWLEDGMENT PROCEDURE), THEN THAT AFFIRMATIVE ASSENT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF YOUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE TO THIS AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, YOUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE IS NOT REQUIRED TO EVIDENCE OR FACILITATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE AND AGREEMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT, AS YOU AGREE THAT THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT AS RELATING TO YOUR ACCEPTANCE AND AGREEMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT ALONE SUFFICES.
No Waiver. No
failure or delay to exercise any right, remedy, power, or privilege
arising from or in connection with this Agreement will operate or be
construed as a waiver thereof, except as otherwise expressly stated
in this Agreement. Any waiver authorized on one occasion is
effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated, and
does not operate as a waiver on any future occasion.
Assignment and Delegation. You shall not assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer any of your
rights or obligations under this Agreement without VENT's prior
written consent in each instance.
Construction and Interpretation. This Agreement shall be construed to have been drafted by all of
the Parties, so that any rule of construction or interpretation that
construes or interprets ambiguities against the drafter shall have
no force or effect.
Headings. Section
headings are inserted in this Agreement for reference and
convenience only and shall not interpret, define, limit, or describe
the scope, intent, terms, or conditions of this Agreement.
Severability. If
any term or condition of this Agreement is deemed invalid or
unenforceable by the arbitrator or (if applicable) a court of law
with binding authority, then the remaining terms and conditions
shall not be affected, and said arbitrator or court of law shall
reform the invalidated or unenforceable term or condition to the
maximum extent permitted under the law and consistent with the
intent of this Agreement.
Entire Agreement.
This Agreement, together with those additional terms, conditions,
and policies referenced herein and/or made available herein by
hyperlink (including the Site's Privacy Policy and Refund Policy),
constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, supersedes any
prior agreements and understandings, if any, between the Parties
with respect to such subject matter, and shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.
