About Us YUNDA Stead is an eco-centric homestead offering life & work experience in sustainability, ecology, climate education, permaculture / biodynamic / nutritional agriculture as well as music, art, bodywork, and meditation retreats in the beautiful Noosa Hinterlands of Sunshine Coast region in Queensland Australia.
We have majestic vistas of the surrounding Noosa Beach region and the northern end of the Sunshine Coast hinterland. There are six peaks visible from our front entry including: Mount Cooran, Pinbarren, Cooroora, Mount Boulder, Tinbeerwah, and more…
Our 50 acre property is a third natural rainforest, a third regenerated native forest, and a third grassland with orchards, gardens and amenities. It’s been naturally organic since 1984 following 40 years as dairy pastureland, 40 years as a banana plantation, and a timber harvest in 1909.
We try to sustainably re-purpose and thoughtfully  leverage all our available resources to grow… through the efforts of helpers we create, through the generosity of supporters we are better able to thrive. Want to help?
