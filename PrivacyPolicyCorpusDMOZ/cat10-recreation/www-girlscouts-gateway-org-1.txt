CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Girl Scouts of Gateway Council is committed to providing a safe,
secure, and fun online experience for children who visit our site. We
are dedicated to safeguarding any personally identifiable information
collected online and to helping parents and children have positive
experiences on the Internet.   We will never knowingly request
personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13
without prior verifiable parental consent. With parental consent, we
may collect information from children under the age of 13 such as:
name, address, email address, account information, and user generated
content. This information allows us to fulfill a requested transaction
and facilitate participation in online programs, keep records,
undertake certain marketing activities, or to otherwise customize or
enhance the Web site experience for children.
Children under the age of 13 may be able to make certain content
such as user generated content visible to others or the public. This
could include, for example, a webpage or parts of webpages operated by
children that have been designed for group or public viewing. However,
absent parental consent, children under 13 would be allowed to display
only limited information such as a first name or unique user name or
other information that does not allow for online contacting by third parties.
Regardless of what information is displayed, parents can revoke
their consent and ask that information about their children be deleted
from the site by contacting our offices by phone at (904) 388-4653 or
via email at councilcontact@girlscouts-gateway.org.  To do this or to
review personally identifiable information collected from children, we
must verify the identity of the requesting parent. When a parent
revokes consent, we will stop collecting, using, or disclosing
information from that child. To respect the privacy of parents,
information collected and used for the sole purpose of obtaining
verifiable parental consent or providing notice is not maintained in
retrievable form by the site if parental consent is not obtained after
a reasonable time.
Submissions
Girl Scouts of Gateway Council welcomes children to learn more about
our organization and, where appropriate, participate in polls and
surveys, as well as submit comments, artwork, writings, and other
submissions for posting on our Web site. For this reason, Girl Scouts
of Gateway Council follows the guidelines for interactive electronic
media published by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of
the Better Business Bureau for pages targeted to children under 13.
However, we encourage this be done only with their parent's knowledge
and supervision. We also encourage children to use an alias (e.g.,
"Bookworm", "Skater", etc.), first name, nickname,
initials, or other alternative to full names or screen names which
correspond with an e-mail address for any activities which will
involve public posting.
In keeping with CARU's Principle regarding respecting and fostering
the parents' role in providing guidance for their children, we
encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of e-mail
and other online activities regularly.
USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data may
be automatically collected by the Girl Scouts of Gateway Council Web
site through the use of "cookies" or other similar
technologies such as web beacons. "Cookies" are small text
files a Web site can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the
visitor's ongoing access to and use of the site, and allow a site to
track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow
content improvements. Cookies are not programs that come onto a
visitor's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by
assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside
the assigning site. If a visitor does not want information collected
through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most
browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature.
“Web beacons” are a small snippet of code embedded in webpages
typically used to monitor activity on a webpage and transfer or
collect information, such as information about your Internet Protocol
address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the
browser type that is accessing the site, and the ID number of cookies
placed on your computer.
Girl Scouts of Gateway Council uses "cookie" technology
only to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors in
order to improve visitors' online experience and facilitate their
visit within our site. Girl Scouts of Gateway Council may use web
beacons to improve website services, conduct website analytics, first
party advertising relating to us and our sponsors, and to optimize the
browsing experience.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit
our Web site. These companies may use non-personally
identifiable information (that is, not including your name, address,
e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and
other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
services of interest to you on this or other websites. Read more
information about this
practice at http://www.networkadvertising.org
and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies.
LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES
This site may be linked to other sites and services that are not
maintained by Girl Scouts of Gateway Council. These Web sites have
their own privacy policies, which you should review prior to visiting
them. We have no responsibility for linked Web sites and provide these
links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.
OUR SECURITY SAFEGUARD
The safety and security of your online experience is of the utmost
concern to us. We take measures to implement reasonable physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent
unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the
information we collect online.
Credit Card Safety
Protecting the safety of your credit card information is also
important to us.  For card transactions we process, we use Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit
card information as it is transmitted to us. SSL is an Internet
encryption technology, and a method of scrambling data as it travels
from your computer to our Web site servers. We also encrypt your
credit card number when we store your order and whenever we transfer
that information to participating merchants.
To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit
sensitive information, check the document for your browser for
indication of an SSL connection (most browsers utilize an unbroken or
closed padlock). Verify that SSL is active before submitting sensitive
information to our server. To double-check, verify that the URL or
Address line of your browser for our site begins with "https."
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to
your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished
using a shared computer.
Children
If you are under 18, you need parent/guardian permission to use a
credit card to make purchases online.
