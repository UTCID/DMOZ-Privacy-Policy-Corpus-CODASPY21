Boring aren't we.
To celebrate the achievements of
our Group's members and members of other Group's we meet along our
journey through Scouting, we seek to publish photographs, movies and
works on our website. Only first names are published with photographs
and photographs of Joeys, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers and Leaders are
only published on the website with the consent of the individual
concerned.
Once you leave this site and go to
a non-1st Deer Park website a different privacy statement is likely
to apply and therefore you should check the security of the new
website.

website are not necessarily those of Scouts Australia.
