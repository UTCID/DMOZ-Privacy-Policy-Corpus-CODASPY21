The Lincoln Owners Group user agreement and rules:
You accept the full content below by viewing or registering as a member of LincolnForums.com.

LincolnForums.com is not the "publisher or speaker" of any posts in the discussion forums unless posted by Administrator.
We want to promote a clean, healthy, respectful atmosphere where people are
not afraid to ask questions, participate in this community and generally have
a good time discussing the things we love most - cars, stereos, meeting new
people, etcetera. Any posts or threads that break these rules may be deleted or edited at any time at the discretion of LincolnForums.com. There is no guarantee that any
posts or threads will be deleted or edited, however, even if they break forum
rules. The volume of posts at LincolnForums.com does not allow for review
of all messages or action on all emails sent to us reporting messages that
violate the rules.
This Service is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are younger than this, please do not register for this Service. If you register for this Service, you represent that you are this age or older.
All content you submit, upload, or otherwise make available to the Service ("Content") may be reviewed by staff members. All Content you submit or upload may be sent to third-party verification services (including, but not limited to, spam prevention services). Do not submit any Content that you consider to be private or confidential.
You agree to not use the Service to submit or link to any Content which is defamatory, abusive, hateful, threatening, spam or spam-like, likely to offend, contains adult or objectionable content, contains personal information of others, risks copyright infringement, encourages unlawful activity, or otherwise violates any laws. You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.
You are granting us with a non-exclusive, permanent, irrevocable, unlimited license to use, publish, or re-publish your Content in connection with the Service.
These terms may be changed at any time without notice.

Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless LincolnForums.com and its owner from and against all losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation by you of these Terms and Conditions. LincolnForums.com reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.
Violation of the rules listed below are grounds for immediate banning of your
account at moderator or administrator discretion. Violation of these rules
may alternatively result in a reduction of access.
===============================================================
The rules:
No profanity in subject lines or signatures.
No discussion of religion, politics or sexual preference.
No spamming or commercial solicitation of any kind by members unless specifically
given the right by administrators. Any such messages can be removed at the
discretion of either a forum moderator or administrator. Selling of individual
items is permissible by a private owner in our Classifieds forums, however
selling multiple items of the same product is considered a commercial post
and may be removed at the discretion of moderators and/or staff.
Commercial solicitations may be posted in the forum they most apply to as
long as the company conducting the group buy is a supporting vendor at LincolnForums.com.
Messages promoting a commercial entity that is not a supporting vendor of
LincolnForums.com may be deleted at any time at the discretion of LincolnForums.com
moderators and administrators.
No flaming of other members to incite or perpetuate a conflict or argument. Please note that continuously straddling the line of breaking the rules or being less than respectful to others will reflect the same type of disciplinary action as directly breaking the rules.
Personal attacks or name-calling can get you banned.
No bombing forums or threads with pointless posts.
No linking or posting of pornographic or objectionable material.
No linking to other forums, message boards or communities that are primarily Lincoln-related. We've worked hard to generate more traffic than any other Lincoln website on the net. If you want to persuade our hard-earned members to visit your site, contact us for a link exchange.
Do not impersonate other individuals or falsely represent yourself.
Do not discuss, suggest, engage, or encourage any illegal activity on the
forums. Linking to locations that deal with any such activity are also forbidden.
Posting under secondary usernames or alias user names other than your main
account for the purpose of arguing, degrading or belittling other readers is
grounds for having your posting privileges revoked.
You must have a valid e-mail account in your profile so you can be reached
by a forum moderator or administrator.
====================================================================
The rules listed below are here to make the forums easier to use and more
conducive to friendly discussion. Violation of the rules below may result in
points being taken from your user account but may also be grounds for immediate
removal of posting rights:
Respect both forum moderators and administrators.
Post in a manner that promotes good will in the community. A few examples
of what not to do: do not post racially derogatory comments or make threats
of personal violence in the forums. It is up to the discretion of LincolnForums.com
moderators and administrators as to what constitutes inappropriate posting
behavior. Please use common sense and be civil and we won't have any
problems.
Try to post to the forum that is most appropriate for the topic being presented.
No cross-posting in multiple forum sections.
Refrain from using profanity or cr3ative spell1ng to get around the censor
filters.
Respect the privacy of other members and individuals. Do not post personal
information about them (i.e. addresses, phone numbers, passwords, etc.).
Observe all copyright laws when posting copyrighted material.
Do not post messages that violate Federal, State, or Local laws which include,
but are not limited to, anything that violates a copyright, trademark, patent,
trade secret, or is bound by NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement).
Under no circumstances may any member edit-out and/or delete content that
he or she has posted in the past or present. Anything posted in our forums
is to be considered the rightfully owned content of LincolnForums.com..
Furthermore, advertising on LincolnForums.com will only be permitted by officially
recognized site sponsors. Advertising includes, but is not limited to, direct
and indirect solicitation of business in posts, business contact information,
use of corporate logos, or use of any language or image that can be construed
as an advertisement. Posting is defined by posts in forums, signature files,
personal messages and e-mails sent from LincolnForums.com.
All user generated content, images, posts, and discussions, contained on LincolnForums.com are the intellectual property of LincolnForums.com. LincolnForums.com reserves the right to overwrite or replace any affiliate, commercial, or monetizable links, posted by users of LincolnForums.com, with our own internal tracking.
=======================================================
Moderators and administrators review many forum messages for those that are
in violation of LincolnForums.com rules. Any messages found to be in violation
may be deleted without warning or explanation. LincolnForums.com also reserves
the right to ban any user, at any time, and for any reason.
There are going to be topics and discussions that will have heated debates.
Please think before you post and re-read what you type before you post it.
Keep your comments limited to the debate at hand and do not make this a personal
issue between you and another reader. There is tremendous diversity in age,
race, gender, language, location (worldwide) and more here and there will be
a lot of varying opinions on different subjects. We're all human beings and
we're all drawn to this site because we have a common bond as car enthusiasts.
Considering the real-time nature of this bulletin board, it is impossible
for LincolnForums.com to review all messages or confirm the validity of information
posted. Please remember that LincolnForums.com does not actively monitor the
contents of all posted messages and is not responsible for any messages posted.
LincolnForums.com does not vouch for or warrant the accuracy, completeness
or usefulness of any message, and is not responsible for the contents of any
message. The messages express the views of the author of the message, not necessarily
the views of LincolnForums.com or any entity associated with LincolnForums.com.
Any user who feels that a posted message is objectionable is encouraged to
contact us immediately by email. LincolnForums.com has the ability to remove
objectionable messages and will make every effort to do so, within a reasonable
time frame, if it is determined that removal is necessary. This is a manual
process, however, so please realize that we may not be able to remove or edit
particular messages immediately, in fact, we may not edit or delete posts that
break our rules at all. We have many time constraints on us and cannot guarantee
that we will be able to edit or delete posts that break the rules/user agreement.
If you do not agree with this then do not view or register for LincolnForums.com.
Although this Discussion Forum does not and cannot review the messages posted
and is not responsible for the content of any of these messages, we at LincolnForums.com
reserve the right to delete any message for any or no reason whatsoever. You
remain soley responsible for the content of your messages, and you agree to
indemnify and hold harmless LincolnForums.com, XenForo Ltd. (the makers of the bulletin board software), and their agents with respect

(or whatever information we know about you) in the event of a complaint or
legal action arising from any message posted by you.
A valid email address is required for registration so that your password can
be sent to you personally. This has been done to prevent and safeguard the
LincolnForums.com forums from random attacks and people looking to cause problems
and spam these forums. LincolnForums.com does *NOT* sell or distribute your
email address to any third parties. The option to have your email address visible
in your posts on these forums is controlled and determined by settings in your
profile which you control. If you feel uncomfortable submitting your email
address, you can go to a number of free email services on the Internet to get
a second email address for the purposes of registering on bulletin boards like
