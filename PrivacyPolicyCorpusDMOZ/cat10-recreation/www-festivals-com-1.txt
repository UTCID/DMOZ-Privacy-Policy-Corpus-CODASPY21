without limitation, all limitations on liability, releases, indemnification
obligations, disclaimers of warranties, and intellectual property protections
and licenses).

GENERAL.
Entire Agreement.
This TOS constitutes the entire
agreement between you and FESTIVALS.COM and governs your use of the
Services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals,
discussions or communications between you and FESTIVALS.COM on the subject
matter hereof. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that
may apply when you use affiliate services, third party Content, third party
software or the Services in a manner other than as governed by this TOS.
If
you are an Organizer, you may be subject to additional terms and conditions
that may apply to your use of the Services.
Choice of Law.
This TOS and the provision of the
Services to you are governed by the laws of the state of New Jersey, U.S.A., as
such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely
within New Jersey by New Jersey residents.
Arbitration.
Any controversy or claim arising out of
or relating to this TOS or the provision of the Services shall be exclusively
settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration
rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. Any such
controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not
be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other
party. The arbitration shall be conducted in Camden, New Jersey, and judgment
on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. Subject to the foregoing arbitration provision, you and FESTIVALS.COM
agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the
city and county of Camden, New Jersey. Either you or FESTIVALS.COM may
seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction

(or its agents, suppliers, and subcontractors) pending the completion of
arbitration.
Waiver; Invalid Provisions.
The failure or delay of FESTIVALS.COM
to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this TOS shall not constitute
a waiver of such right or provision. No oral waiver, amendment or modification
shall be effective under any circumstance whatsoever. If any provision of this
TOS is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to
give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the
other provisions of this TOS shall remain in full force and effect.
Time to File Claim.
You agree that regardless of any statute
or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related
to use of the Services or this TOS must be filed within two (2) years after
such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
