These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
The parties that control the processing of Personal Data for behavioral advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from personalization and profiling. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other Inference Data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement.
We generally use targeted advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third-party goods and services, to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites (such as Facebook).

Cookie Policy
This website is one of several websites (the “Site(s)”) that are owned and operated by Xanterra Leisure Holding, LLC (together with its affiliates and subsidiaries “Xanterra” “we” or “us”). Please read this Cookie and Similar Technology Policy (“Cookie Policy”) to understand how we use cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies, how we share information they provide, and how you can control or manage your consent to the collection of data using these technologies.
This Cookie Policy is incorporated into our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Capitalized terms not defined here will have the definitions set forth in these agreements.
We use cookies and similar technologies in the following ways and as otherwise communicated to you from time to time (subject to your consent when required by applicable laws).
What are cookies and similar technologies?
A cookie is a small text file that a website places on your browser. Cookies are used by most websites for security, to learn about and improve upon how users navigate a website, or to enable various features. For example, cookies can allow the website to save your password, determine whether it is your first visit to the website and how long you stayed on each page, determine if you were brought to the website from another website, and other similar information.
Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags typically function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email. The request for these files from a server reveals certain information, such as your browser type, IP address, and other information. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons) are electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information such as ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Digital Sites and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. We may also use these automated technologies to collect, analyze, and correlate with other tracking technologies certain information related to the devices you use to access the Digital Sites, such as IP addresses, browser type and version, browser language, OS version, unique device identifiers, and other information about your computer(s) and/or mobile device(s), to the extent made available by your device, OS, or your chosen configuration or choices. In certain cases, these technologies may be used to identify your device or browser through a common process known as “device fingerprinting.”
Other tracking technologies also include locally shared objects (also known as ‘Flash cookies,’) HTML cookies, or other tracking software that stores data on your device on behalf of third parties. These files may be installed through your browser or other software on your computer that is used by your browser. These files may be installed by us or a third party. To control the storage of data through such software, users may be required to change their preferences in the software itself, through a browser, or through the use of specialized add-ons or plug ins.
What is the difference between session and persistent cookies?
All cookies have a time limit for which they will be stored. Cookies are typically classified as “session cookies” or “persistent cookies” depending on how long they will be stored. Session cookies remain on your browser while you are logged on to a particular website and typically ‘expire’ or are deleted from your device when or shortly after you leave the website, close the browser, or when you delete them. Persistent cookies remain on your device for longer periods of time, sometimes indefinitely, or until you delete them.
How can these technologies affect my privacy?
Information from cookies and similar technologies may be used to collect information about your activities over time and across sites.
