FIRST PARTY COOKIES
First party cookies are cookies set by www.cfps.co.uk and can only be read by www.cfps.co.uk
TYPES OF FIRST PARTY COOKIES USED ON THIS WEBSITE
First Party Session Cookies
First party session cookies are stored by www.cfps.co.uk temporarily during a browsing session, and are deleted when you close your browser.
First party cookies on this website are used to give a more seamless browsing experience. If you wish to disable these cookies, we recommend you do so by disabling them directly within your browser. Please see the link at the bottom of this page for instructions on how to do so. Disabling these cookies may result in a slight degradation in the browsing experience of the site.
First Party Persistent Cookies
First party persistent cookies are stored by a website for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where a website needs to remember your preferences, for example, for more than one browsing session, and automatically apply them the next time you visit the site.
THIRD PARTY COOKIES
Third Party Cookies are set by organisations other than www.cfps.co.uk. For example, we use a third party web service (WordPress) which will set cookies to perform this service. They can be either session or persistent cookies.
This website may also contain content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Twitter which can set their own (third party) cookies. See below for more information on Third Party Cookies.
YOUTUBE
Web pages on the site may occasionally include embedded YouTube videos. Where this occurs, YouTube can drop standard, and flash-based, cookies to collect analytical information. If you wish to disable these cookies, we recommend you do so by disabling them directly within your browser. Please see the link at the bottom of this page for instructions on how to do so.

Google Maps and Google API
This website may use embedded Google Maps and the Google API to enhance site content. Google capture some information as you view a map on their servers, to remember options and preferences such as location, zoom level or type of map, but some analytical information is also transferred about usage.
If you wish to disable these cookies, we recommend you do so by disabling them directly within your browser. Please see the link at the bottom of this page for instructions on how to do so.
Disabling these cookies may result in embedded Google Maps not being displayed correctly (or at all) and not remembering preferences such as location, zoom level or type of map.
