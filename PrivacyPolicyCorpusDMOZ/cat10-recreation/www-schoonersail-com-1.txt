5. The Voyage
a. You acknowledge that sailing can be a dangerous activity, which can be both physically and mentally challenging, especially in rough weather which can occur at any time during any voyage or Taster weekend.
b. SchoonerSail will make every effort not to change or cancel any advertised voyage however reasons beyond our control including, but not limited to, unsuitable weather can make this necessary; therefore ports of joining, leaving and ports of call are not guaranteed. Your booking is also subject to the regulatory environment allowing the voyage to take place. If a voyage is cancelled prior to the advertised start date all voyage fees paid will be refunded in full but SchoonerSail, the skipper and/or crew shall otherwise have no liability whatsoever for the vessel not fulfilling or completing the advertised itinerary.

d. For reasons of safety you agree to follow the instructions of the skipper and/or his delegated representative at all times and to participate fully in any instruction,safety briefing, or training that is being given.
e. The skipper and/or his delegated representative’s decision is final in all matters relating to the safe operation of Trinovante and her tenders.
f. For reasons of safety alcohol is only consumed at the skippers discretion and never at sea. This does not mean Trinovante is a ‘dry’ boat – you can drink on board just not when we are underway or may get underway. Smokers may smoke on deck.
g. You understand that SchoonerSail voyages are often well off the beaten track in wilderness areas therefore you may have to get on and off the boat using dock side ladders, by climbing over other boats etc. Do not expect to be stepping on and off marina pontoons. Please make sure you meet the required fitness levels before you book – if you are in doubt ask us. Sailing on Trinovante is more of an expedition type of experience than a holiday.
h. No animals, unlawful drugs, weapons, or goods of any kind are to be brought on board.
i. Guests under the age of 18 by special arrangement only.
j. SchoonerSail is not responsible for sailing guests while they are ashore
k. It is customary for sailing guests to get involved with the washing up onboard
l. You agree to provide your own waterproof non-slip footwear suitable for wet conditions.
6. Health and Safety. Remember these conditions are aimed at your safety not ours.
Be aware that you will be out of reach of the usual shore-side emergency medical services on all voyages and taster weekends.
a. It is a condition of booking that you have a level of health and fitness sufficient to allow you to actively participate in all activities on board. If you are in any doubt as to what to expect whilst sailing on board Trinovante, or you have any questions about filling in the booking form do ring us on the boat phone for a chat. We are not medical experts but we can describe likely ‘at sea conditions’ and discuss general issues with you.
As a rough guide line a good level of agility is much more important than brute physical strength or aerobic fitness. If you are significantly overweight such that your agility is affected it is likely you will struggle with activities onboard.
b. Failure to declare information relevant to your medical fitness and/or your ability to actively participate in sailing on board may result in you not being allowed to sail and/or to continue with a voyage if the captain feels that your safety or the safety of others may be put at risk. No refunds or travel allowances will be given if you have to leave the boat for this reason.
c. You must notify SchoonerSail of any changes in your health and fitness that arise between booking and sailing.
d. You agree to provide a letter from your GP, at your own expense, on a form provided by SchoonerSail stating your fitness to sail on a specified voyage, if it is deemed necessary by SchoonerSail.
e. In the event of medical emergency you agree to reimburse SchoonerSail for any expenses that may be incurred for medical treatment and/or evacuation from the vessel and/or repatriation.
f. You must inform the captain of any medication that you are taking whilst you are on board. If you are taking medication please make sure to consult your doctor about any problems seasickness may cause with your medication and the suitability of any seasickness remedies you might be taking. If you will need seasickness medication make sure you bring enough with you.
g. Special dietary requirements must be advised at the time of booking.
All of the above may lead you to think you must be super fit to sail with us. This is not the case and we do our best to facilitate people so please do phone us for a chat if you are unsure. Our main concern is that your holiday is safe and enjoyable.
