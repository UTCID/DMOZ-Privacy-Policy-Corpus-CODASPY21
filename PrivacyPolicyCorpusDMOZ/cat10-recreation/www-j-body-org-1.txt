Terms of Service
GM Enthusiast Network ("GME") provides its service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service, which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: http://www.gmenthusiast.com/terms/.
GME may also offer other services from time to time, that are governed by different Terms of Service.
j-body.org is a subsite of GME. The following terms of service apply to GME, j-body.org, and all sites owned or operated under GME.
DESCRIPTION
GME provides users with access to a collection of resources, including, various communications tools, forums, shopping, and other content and programming (the "Service"). You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for GME to provide the Service. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that enhance the current Service, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that GME assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or settings.
YOUR REGISTRATION
In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or GME has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, GME has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). GME is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its members, particularly minors. Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience.
PRIVACY POLICY
Registration Data and other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy. For more information, see our full privacy policy at http://www.gmenthusiast.com/privacy/.
MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY
You will have created a password and account username upon completing the Service's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify GME of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. GME cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.
CONDUCT
You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This means that you, and not GME, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service. GME does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will GME be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.
You agree to not use the Service to:
upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
harm minors in any way;
impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, a 'GME Exec', forum moderator, chat op, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;
forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any Content transmitted through the Service;
upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);
upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights ("Rights") of any party;
upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation, except in any areas that might be designated for such purpose;
upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;
interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the Service;
intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national or international law;
"stalk" or otherwise harass another; or
collect or store personal data about other users.
You acknowledge that GME does not pre-screen Content, but that GME and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or move any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, GME and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by GME or submitted to GME.
You acknowledge and agree that GME may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of GME, its members and the public.
You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

GME does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for inclusion on the Service. However, with respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Service, you grant GME the following world-wide, royalty free and non-exclusive license(s), as applicable:
With respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of GME, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed.
"Publicly accessible" areas of the Service are those areas of GME that are intended by GME to be available to the general public.
INDEMNITY
