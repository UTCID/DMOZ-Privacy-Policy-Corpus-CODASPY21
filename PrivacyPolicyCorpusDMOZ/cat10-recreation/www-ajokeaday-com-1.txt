If two or more provisions of the Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, Sponsor shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.
21.	NON-WAIVER
We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law.
