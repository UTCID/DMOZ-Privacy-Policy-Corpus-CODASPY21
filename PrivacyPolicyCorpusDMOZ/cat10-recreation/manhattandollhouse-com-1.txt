Information Collection and Use
Information collected on this site will not be sold, shared or rented to
others.
Order
We request information from customers on our order form. Here customers
must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial
information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is
used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble
processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with a
customer.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the customer’s hard drive containing
information about the user. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, users
will not have to provide address details each time they order and the shopping
basket can remember products purchased at an earlier time. Cookies are stored
on the customer’s computer only. We have no access to their content.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s
movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses
are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Links
This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we
are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage
our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements
of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
Security
The security of your information is very important to us. We use the 128-bit
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online
order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect
it from being decoded by anyone other than Manhattan Dollhouse. Once you enter
the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with our server in
secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following:
The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https"
Depending on the browser, you may see a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer,
AOL, Firefox) in the lower section for the browser window, also indicating
that you are in a secure mode.
Only browsers that use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer technology are able
to order through the Manhattan Dollhouse site. If your browser does not support
SSL, or you get an error message, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Firefox's
home page for further information. If you have any questions about the security
of our website, please send us an email.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on
our main page so our users are always aware of what information we collect,
how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any
point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different
from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email.
Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this
different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy
under which the information was collected.
