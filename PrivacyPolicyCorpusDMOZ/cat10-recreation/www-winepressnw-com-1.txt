as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process;

when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of our affiliates or us, or to protect the safety of you or others;
to detect, prevent, or respond to potential fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Service, violations of law, or other misuse of our services
to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other transfer of all or part of our assets; or
subject to your consent.
We do not share your credit card information or other financial information to third parties for their marketing purposes or other independent use. When we share information with third parties for processing credit card or other payments, we require those third parties to comply with applicable Payment Card Industry standards.
We may share Aggregated Information with third parties that provide content and services for us. We may also share Aggregated Information with advertisers and others so that they can better understand our audience. For example, we might disclose the gender, age, or geographical breakdown of our user base.
Unless you have consented otherwise, we do not sell, rent, barter, or otherwise give away user lists, users' names, email addresses, or mailing addresses so that advertisers or other third parties may send you advertisements or other solicitations.
You should know that when you voluntarily disclose personal information publicly on our services (for example, when commenting on articles), that information may be collected and used by others and you may receive unsolicited communications from other people.
When you share information via features offered on our services by other companies (sometimes known as “third-party plugins”), the privacy settings of the other companies for those features govern how the information will be shared. When you are logged into our services, depending on the service you are logged into, your name may be displayed, and your email address and contact information may be viewed.
Be sure to logout of your account and take other steps to ensure that others cannot view that information without your knowledge.
Third-Party Links and Content
Our services and communications may contain links to or content from websites or other online services provided by third parties.
We expect our partners and third-party providers to respect your privacy, but you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by websites and other services that are not under our control.
The privacy practices of third parties are governed by their privacy policies, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of all websites and online services that you use, view, or visit.
Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies
We may use cookies, web beacons (also known as pixels), and other technologies to collect information when you use our services. These technologies help us remember you when you visit our services, personalize your experience on the services, learn about how you and others use the services, learn about the devices you use to access the services, and remember your preferences.
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website stores on your computer or device in the cookie file associated with the browser that you use to access the website. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies alone generally cannot be used to identify you.
But if you choose the "Remember Me" feature or similar features, a cookie will store information that helps remember you, such as your username.
Cookies help us recognize you when you return to our websites and hold information from one visit to the next for your ease of use.
Cookies also help us better understand how people use our services through click-stream analysis, which allows us to design a better user experience. We may also share information that we collect with third parties, such as service providers, advertisers, and advertising companies as described in this Privacy Policy.
Certain third-party content providers, advertisers, and advertising companies may also place cookies on your computer or mobile device. Those cookies are controlled by the third parties and are not governed by this Privacy Policy.
Further information on our use of cookies, including how to disable them or register your preferences regarding their use, is contained in the
Interest Based Advertising section of this Privacy Policy.
We and some of our advertisers work with ad networks and ad delivery platforms that place retargeting pixels on users’ computers to gather information about users’ online activities, such as browsing histories and demographic information. This information can be aggregated into audience segments, which help deliver relevant advertising to users visiting our websites and third-party websites that use the same pixels.
Some of our services and communications may contain tiny electronic images known as web beacons. We use web beacons to assist us in delivering cookies on our services and to allow us to count users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons in promotional email messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
We also participate in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Cooperative, which uses Device Identifiers (the unique number associated with a smartphone or similar device) to better understand how you use certain websites and apps across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions. Learn more about how Adobe does this and how you may opt-out of this program.
Interest-Based Advertising
To help ensure that you receive ads that are relevant to your interests on our services, our advertisers’ services, and elsewhere on the Internet, we and third-parties (including service providers, advertisers, and advertising companies) may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps, and devices.
We and third parties may use that information to help understand audience segments.
Advertisers may use the segments to determine the audience groups to which they wish to deliver particular ads.
Through this process, we do not use information that directly identifies you.
You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on your computer or laptop from some companies, including us and our service providers, by visiting the following sites:
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/,

If you wish to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on your mobile device, please see the advertising preferences information on support.apple.com for iOS devices or support.google.com for Android devices.

If you are accessing our services from Europe, please see www.youronlinechoices.com.
If you are accessing our services from Canada, please see youradchoices.ca.
Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive advertising.
It means that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.
If you do not wish to allow cookies to be placed on your computer or device, you can configure your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.) to control the use of cookies. Please note that the interest-based advertising opt outs provided in the links above may rely on the use of cookies. If you disable or delete cookies, you may remove your opt-out preferences. Deleting and/or controlling the use of cookies AND visiting the opt-out links above to register your preferences will help to ensure that you do not receive interest-based advertising.
Again, this does not mean that you will not receive ads, it simply means that you will not receive ads that are tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.
Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not respond to browser Do Not Track signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate; if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so here.

Children's Privacy
We care about children’s privacy. Our services are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 18.
We will not knowingly allow children under 18 to register for or become members of our services. If we discover that we have received any information from a child under 18, we will take reasonable steps to promptly remove that information.

In general, if you register to use any of our services, you may update the information you have provided to us for any of our services by visiting the account information page of that service.
When you register for our services, you may be able to indicate your preferences regarding marketing communications.
In the Newsletter Management page of our services, you may be able to change those preferences and select the categories of communications that interest you.
When we or our affiliates send you emails containing offers that may be of interest of you, those emails may contain links via which you may opt out of receiving those communications.
You will not be able to opt-out of receiving certain service-related or transactional communications relating to our services unless you cancel your registration or subscription.
Even after your account is cancelled, we may retain your information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Security
While we strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information, no information system can be 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we cannot be responsible for information that you transmit over networks that we do not control or information that you choose to publicly disclose. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords or other account information.
We make reasonable efforts to secure the account information pages and other registration locations for our services, such that they can be accessed only by our authorized personnel or by logging in with your member name and password.
We endeavor to protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using technology that encrypts information you submit.

Request Information/Request
Deletion
Do Not Sell My Personal
Information
In order to protect your Personal Information, please note that:
Only you or an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act
on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information;
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month
period;
The request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about
whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative; and
The description of the request must provide sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or
authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Although you may use an
authorized agent to submit a request to opt-out on your behalf, we may deny a request from an authorized agent
that does not submit proof with the request that they have been authorized by you to act on the consumer’s
behalf.
It is important to know that you are not required to create an account with us to make a verifiable request. We
will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity
or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an
account with us, we will deliver our written response through our
web portal. Any disclosures we provide will
only cover the 12-month period preceding your verifiable request's receipt. For data portability requests, we
will select an industry-acceptable format to provide your Personal Information.
Unless a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we will not charge a fee to process or respond to your
verifiable consumer request. If we determine that a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we will tell
you why we made that decision and reserve the right to either refuse to act on your request or charge you a
reasonable fee to complete your request.
