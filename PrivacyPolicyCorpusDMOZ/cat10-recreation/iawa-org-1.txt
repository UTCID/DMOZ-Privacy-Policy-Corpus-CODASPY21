In order to facilitate online transactions and allow user access to Members-Only features, IAWA collects certain information including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, membership IDS, and credit card numbers.

The IAWA website requires you to provide personally identifiable information in order to use certain functions of the site. By providing such information, you consent to IAWA’s collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Statement.
The information you provide may include information collected during the registration process, including contact information (name, address, phone number, e-mail address, dietary restrictions, certification status, website URLs and titles) and financial information (credit card number). This information will be used to process your order and, if necessary, to contact you regarding the status of your order.

IAWA understands the importance of minimizing the amount of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) data it maintains and retains such data only as long as necessary. We maintain organizational record retention procedures, which dictate the length of data retention to meet business, legal and operational needs.
IAWA will not ask your permission to collect or use aggregate information about website visitors or users of our products and services since aggregate data does not identify you as a specific individual.

At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, the disclosure is necessary.
