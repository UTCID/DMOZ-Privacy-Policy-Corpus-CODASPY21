Information which you voluntarily provide to us when using this website (including, without limitation, your name, postal address(es), telephone number(s) and e-mail address(es))
Information about your use of this website
For what purposes do we hold personal information?
We hold information which you provide to us for our own administrative, sales, marketing and product/service development purposes.
Depending on the information which you have provided to us, we may contact you by letter, e-mail, fax, telephone or SMS. If you would rather not be contacted by us, please let us know at the address noted below.
Unless you object in writing to us at the time the relevant personal information is collected, you consent to our use of the information set out or referred to in this Privacy Policy.
Unless we have your prior consent, we shall not sell, rent, trade or share any personal information which we hold except that:
We may disclose information which is held by us where required to do so by law or in connection with legal proceedings;
We may disclose aggregate statistics to third parties which are made up from statistics in respect of individual persons but these statistics will not include personally identifying information;
We may disclose personal information to our legal, accounting, marketing or other professional advisers, our website hosts and our courier, postal or transport providers, and insurers (names and addresses only in the latter case);
we may disclose personal information to other companies within the Asian Geographic Magazines group.
Should we wish to use your personal information for a purpose not permitted under this Privacy Policy, we will contact you to seek your consent.
For how long do we hold personal information?
We will not hold on to any personal information for any longer than is reasonably necessary for the purposes noted above
What procedures do we use to protect your privacy?
We undertake to process the personal information which we collect in accordance with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable laws relating to data protection.
We have strict security procedures covering the storage and disclosure of your information (although we do not warrant that this is the case) in order to prevent unauthorised access. This means that we may ask for proof of identity before disclosing personal information to you.
This website contains links to other websites. Equally, other websites may provide links to this website. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies, if any, of each and every website which you use.
Please note that the Internet is not a secure medium. When submitting personal information to us using the Internet, your details may not be secure from access by third parties. The submission of personal information to us using the Internet is therefore made at your own risk.
We will also, on written request from you, amend any personal information which we hold about you. Where we amend the personal information which we hold about you, we will generally retain a copy of the previous version for our records. However, as noted above, we will not hold on to any personal information for any longer than is necessary for the purposes noted above.
