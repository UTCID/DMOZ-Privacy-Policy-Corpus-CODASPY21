Comprised of State Routes 73, 133, 241 and 261, The Toll Roads make up 20 percent of Orange County’s highway system and are the fastest, easiest and most predictable way to get to and through Orange County.

Paying Tolls
All tolls on The Toll Roads are collected electronically -- there are no toll booths at which to stop and pay cash.
Visitors and infrequent drivers can pay tolls within 5 days before or 5 days after driving The Toll Roads using our free app or online at TheTollRoads.com.
If you are visiting family or friends, find out if they have a FasTrak® account with The Toll Roads. If so, they can temporarily add your vehicle's license plate number to their account, which will allow you to drive The Toll Roads with no worries about paying online.
Resolving a Toll Violation
If you drive The Toll Roads without paying a toll(s), you will receive a Notice of Toll Evasion in the mail. If it was your first time driving The Toll Roads without paying, the notice will include information on how to pay the toll only (without penalties). Pay, resolve or monitor the status of a violation.
Repeat Visitors
Frequent visitors should consider signing up for a FasTrak Charge account to have tolls charged individually to a designated credit card at the end of each day their license plate passes through a tolling point. There are no monthly maintenance fees and your card is only charged when you drive the road. Also, if you are using a rental car you can temporarily add a vehicle's license plate to your account. Sign Up for FasTrak Charge.
