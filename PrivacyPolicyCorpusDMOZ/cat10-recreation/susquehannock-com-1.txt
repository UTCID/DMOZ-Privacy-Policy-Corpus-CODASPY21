Camp Susquehannock Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. We maintain the privacy of your email address, name, phone number, password, and all other private information submitted to us in the registration process (unless you enter such information as your username or in the text of your entries to user areas). Also, please note that information provided through Facebook or other social networks, or for publication on fan pages, mobile apps or websites may be subject to different privacy policies which may vary materially from these terms applying to our web sites.
The Information We Collect
Any information gathered by us is used to customize the experience for you the user, and is not shared or sold to any third parties. However, we may in the future provide customized or targeted advertisements to you based upon your data (including usage statistics and characteristics), in which case we may allow third party applications to access such data for the purpose of customizing messages or advertising for you.
Our Commitment to Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy, we use industry standard methods to safeguard and secure the information we collect online, although you recognize that data transmitted online or stored in a facility to which online access is provided cannot be made to be 100% secure. We believe in protecting your information just as we would want our information protected. In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised as may be required by applicable law.
Notifications
It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our users via email notice, text message notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on an Camp Susquehannock Site or Advertisement, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users.
Child Protection
We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13. In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13 from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts.
Use of User Information
Information you provide to us about yourself, or that we collect and infer based upon your entries and posts to an Camp Susquehannock site or Advertisement may be used to improve your user experience, provide or suggest targeted services and to allow third party advertisers and messaging to be tailored or targeted. We may use or provide to third parties aggregated data entered by users or inferred from usage. We may collect IP addresses and cookies for the primary purpose of assisting with ease of use by you. However, except as legally required, we will not sell or provide your email address, IP address, cookies, address or phone number to third parties for advertising or other purposes. In the future we may provide third parties with the ability to provide customizable or targeted advertising or messages and in such cases we may allow third party applications to access your user data in determining the messaging or advertising applicable to you.
