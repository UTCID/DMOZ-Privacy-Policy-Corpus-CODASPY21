Governing Law. The Materials and all other content and features on this Site are presented solely for the purpose of providing entertainment and information and promoting programs, films, music, and other products available in the United States, its territories, possessions, and protectorates.
These Terms of Use shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, as they are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Florida.
Disputes/Arbitration. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT
If a dispute arises between you and us, you agree to provide us with notice of the dispute via email to SheliaDudney@gatorland.com Upon our receipt of the notice, the parties shall have a period of sixty (60) days to attempt to resolve the dispute informally before either may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section.
With the exception of class actions (further discussed in Section 22), claims to enforce intellectual property rights (patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights), and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site, any dispute of any kind between you and any member of the Gatorland Group arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with your use of the Sites (“Dispute”), if unresolved through informal discussions within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice, shall be resolved by binding arbitration in the state in which you reside.
Both parties reserve the right to seek a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order from a federal or state court in the United States. However, after such request for relief has been heard by such court, the remainder of the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration as set forth herein. We reserve the right to demand any remedy for violations of these Terms of Use and/or any other rules and regulations set forth on the Sites, including without limitation the right to block access from a particular Internet protocol (IP) address.
Any arbitrator proceeding over a Dispute shall be a retired judge or justice of any state or federal court with substantial experience in the subject matter relevant to the matter in dispute and shall follow Florida law in adjudicating the dispute. The parties agree that an arbitrator proceeding over a Dispute shall be instructed, whenever practicable, to resolve threshold legal issues by way of motions filed by the parties. The parties also agree that they will follow JAMS streamlined arbitration rules and procedures then in effect in arbitrating any Dispute, except to the extent that the JAMS rules are inconsistent with this Agreement or the class action waiver described below. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If the claim you wish to assert against us is less than $10,000, then, at your election, (i) the arbitration may proceed in-person, by telephone, or by written briefs or (ii) you may in lieu of arbitration bring your claim in small claims court. If either party files a claim in state or federal court that is required by this Agreement to have been brought to arbitration, then the other party shall be entitled to his/her/its reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in successfully compelling arbitration.
To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of the filing fee for a lawsuit, Gatorland will pay the additional cost of the filing fee.
Class Action Waiver. The parties agree that they will resolve their Disputes on an individual basis and that any claims brought under this agreement or in connection with the Sites must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding. The parties further agree that they shall not participate in any class action (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under this agreement or in connection with the Sites. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then such class action is not subject to arbitration and must be litigated in state or federal court in Orange County in the state of Florida.
Severability. If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable for this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the matters contained herein.

(a) your name, address, telephone number, and email address;(b) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;(c) the exact URL or a description of each place where alleged infringing material is located;(d) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use has not been authorized by you, your agent, or the law;(e) your electronic or physical signature or the electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on your behalf; and(f) a statement by you made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
