Insecure.Org privacy policy
(Also applies to related domains: Insecure.Com, Nmap.Org, Ncrack.Org,
and Ncrack.Com)
Insecure.Org respects and protects the privacy of individuals who use
our services.
Individually identifyable information about you is not
willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your
permission, as explained in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").
Anonymous Browsing
The vast majority of content on our sites does not require any sort of
login and can be browsed anonymously.
Of course, your IP address will
be disclosed unless you use a proxy.
Cookies
We may sometimes use cookies to better understand our user base and to
improve the quality of our service.
For example, we might someday use
cookies to allow persistant logins.
Security- and privacy-conscious people often disable cookies in
their browser.
We encourage people to do this.
On Netscape 4.X, the
option is available in the
Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced menu.
Other browsers offer similar options.
Security
We recognize that privacy policies are ineffective if someone can
break into the web and database servers and proceed to abuse the
information.
We constantly monitor public and private security lists
(including these) to stay
abreast of the latest security holes.
Our software is designed with
security as the #1 priority and our network is architected to maximise
resilience to attacks.
Mailing lists
We run several mailing lists such as Nmap-hackers and Nmap-dev.
These are
opt-in lists:
you will only receive mail on them if you explicity
sign up.
Sign up email verification letters are sent to insure that
one user cannot subscribe other people to the lists without their
permission.
Users can unsubscribe from the lists at any time using
instructions sent when they subscribe and in the headers of each message.
Links to other sites
This site contains links to other sites which are developed by
people over whom we exercise no control. We are not responsible for
the privacy practices or the content of such sites.
Public Forums
This site makes chat rooms, forums, mailing lists, message boards, and/or news newsgroups available to its users. Please remember that any
information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal
information.
Mail disclosure
Mail sent to us may occasionally be posted to the site or forwarded
to other people (depending on the nature of the email).
If you want
to clarify that a certain email you send should be kept private, please
say so in the email.
We may post legal threats whether you want us to
or not.
Traffic Data
Each time a visitor comes to our Web sites, our servers -- like
most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information,
including, for example, the visitor's domain name/IP address, referral
data, and user-agent information.
We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our
analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where
traffic comes from, how traffic flows within our sites, etc.).
To
these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into
group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our
advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or
personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do
present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be
able to identify you or contact you.
Support requests and fingerprint submissions
If you send us your IP address in a support request or fingerprint
submission regarding our software, we may probe that address
(including a port scan and OS detection) in order to answer your
question or make use of the fingerprint submission.
If you do not
wish to have a machine probed, please say so or do not include the
IP/hostname in the inforamtion you send us.
Surveys and other information requests
We may occasionally post surveys and other forms requesting
information.
We will not share personally identifiable information
from these forms unless we say otherwise on the survey/form.
We may
share aggregate data about the answers.
For example, here
are the results of one of our surveys.
Your consent and changes to the privacy policy
By using our web sites, you consent to the collection and use of your
information as we have outlined in this policy.
We may decide to
change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post
those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the
information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we
disclose it.
Contacting Insecure.Org
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the
practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can
