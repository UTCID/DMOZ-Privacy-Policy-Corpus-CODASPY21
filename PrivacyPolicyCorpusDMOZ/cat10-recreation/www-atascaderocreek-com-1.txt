We monitor supplier behavior and compliance to ensure that our suppliers meet our high standards.  We encourage our suppliers doing business in countries with increased risk to enroll with third party audit organizations like Fedex, the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange.  It is our policy to cease doing business with any supplier who participates in human trafficking or forced labor practices. If we discover a concern with one of our suppliers, we may require appropriate corrective action or terminate the relationship.We have and are continuing to educate our employees who are involved in the procurement of goods and services about the Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the steps that should be taken to identify, cure, and guard against any use of forced labor in our supply chains.Content here when I have it.
