This site does NOT collect, use, or disclose personal information (including online contact

information in a public forum such as a guest book or antenna forum, we
will delete that information once we become aware of it.
All emails, especially from children, sent to
Hamuniverse.com are confidential between us and them. We always tell the
children to get permission from their parents when contacting us in
future emails. Their email content will not be published or used in
any way unless permission if given by the legal parant or guardian.
The Antenna Formum is off site and we can not preview it
before it is made public but we do get a notice that new entries have
been made and deletion of personal information can be made at that time
by this webmaster. Due to heavy spammers on our guest book, it is no
longer in use!
Note: (Personal information would be defined as any information that could lead another person
directly or indirectly to a child or contact him or her directly
using that information.)
