If a data breach did occur, our first step would be to pull the website offline to minimize the ability of attackers to continue to access the site.

If a breach did occur, we will strive to notify our readers of the breach within 72 hours inform them if any personal information was accessed. Because of our data retention policy, any private information available on our server is limited to email address and your computer’s IP address used at the time of access and a history of voluntary contribution dates and amounts.
