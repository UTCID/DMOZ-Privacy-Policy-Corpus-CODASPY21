Spartanburg Photography Guild Mission Statement: The mission of the Spartanburg Photography Guild is to encouragephotographers, of all ages and experience levels, to increase their knowledge ofthe art of photography through training, sharing, and educational grants, as wellas opportunities to participate in challenges, photo outings, and charitable photoshoots. Monthy CompetionsThere are multiple opportunities to submit digital photos for consideration in Guild
monthly competitions.
Competition winners are chosen from an individual outside the guild and not a guild member.
The current judge of the monthly competitions is a world renowned and accomplished photographer. The deadline for submitting pictures for a monthly competition is 6:00pm on the Friday immediately before the monthly guild meeting (2nd Tuesday of each month).
You are free to submit to any category of your choosing.
However, you are only allowed 3 total submissions per month.
Those submissions could be all in one competition or spread amongst all of them.
The only restriction is that you cannot submit images in Group A and Group B, you must choose one or the other.
Remember that we are on the honor system about your photographic and editing capabilities.
Photos submitted to Group A, Group B and Straight out of the Camera competitions can be of any subject and theme.
Please keep them relatively family friendly - i.e. not nudity just for nudity’s sake.
The Challenge competition has a theme that is chosen by the previous month’s winner. The list below breaks down each monthly competition:•Photo of the Month Group A - Professional and more experienced photographers.
If you understand how to do composites in Photoshop or other editing platforms then this is the group for you. •Photo of the Month Group B - Novice, Intermediate, and Student photographers.
This group is intended for newer photographers or those with lesser Photoshop or other editing platform knowledge and experience. •Straight Out of the Camera (SOOC) - Submissions for this category must be “straight out of the camera” with absolutely no post production edits or cropping.
All exposure settings and composition must be done on the camera at time of pressing the shutter button. •Challenge - Monthly photo theme chosen by the previous month’s winner.
Photos submitted for this competition must be taken during the month between Guild meetings.  Print Competitions There are seasonal print competitions.
The categories for each season are:•Portrait•Event•Sports•Black and White•Architecture•Landscape / Fine Art Prints must not be any larger than larger than 11x14 and mounted on foam board with a maximum of 11x14.
For instance you can submit a 8x10 print on foam board and using foam board as a border.
However, an 11x14 print could not have a border as the foam board could not be any larger than the print.
