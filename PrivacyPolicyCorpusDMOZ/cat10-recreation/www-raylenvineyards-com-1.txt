PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE
At RayLen Vineyards Inc, we recognize and respect our customers’ privacy and diligently protect the trust you have placed in us. We have developed a Privacy Policy to assure you that the information collected about you is only what is needed for conducting business and offering products and services that might be of interest to you. As a user of this site, you are agreeing to these policies.  The privacy of those who visit our website is of primary concern to RayLen Vineyards, Inc. Except as noted, none of this information is shared with outside parties. What information is gathered, how it is obtained, and what it is used for is explained below. If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at (336) 998-3100 or email erin@raylenvineyards.com.
VISIT INFORMATION
Like many companies, RayLen Vineyards automatically tracks the usage of our website. We profile website usage by tracking the pages viewed, the frequency of visits, the browser used ISP and the region our visitors come from. This information is used to analyze trends, track use, and optimize site administration and is not tied to any identifiable person or account. For visits only your activity is anonymous.
REGISTRATION INFORMATION
By purchasing wine from our website, you are consenting to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. In order to purchase wine from our website, you must first complete the registration form. During registration, you are required to give certain contact information (such as name, email address) and create a password. This information is used to contact you about the services on our site for which you have expressed interest (your purchase information will never include your credit card information). You may opt out of receiving communications from us either during registration, or at any other time by emailing us at erin@raylenvineyards.com, or by calling us at (336) 998-3100. We require you to verify your age in order to purchase.
SECURED PURCHASE INFORMATION
When a credit card order is placed on our website, your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date are gathered. This is used to verify payment authorization, process your order, personalize your shopping experience, inform you of deliveries, deliver the merchandise to the proper destination and generate statistics. RayLen Vineyards takes numerous precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and offline.
For all purchase information, RayLen Vineyards uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) underneath HTTP, providing an encrypted channel and server authentication, so that all such information is transmitted through a secured server connection. Before your order is processed online, your browser will make a confirmed identification that the transmission of all data is being made between your computer and with RayLen Vineyards. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take several steps to protect your information offline. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a Customer Service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. If you have any questions about the security of our website, you can email us at erin@raylenvineyards.com or call us at (336) 998-3100.

As a customer of RayLen Vineyards, you have the option to receive RayLen Vineyards newsletters via email. We also communicate with you on a regular basis to provide requested services. We reply to your inquiries on issues relating to your account via email or phone. For instance, when you use the “Contact Us” link, we use this information solely to respond to your questions and comments and to improve our customer service.
On rare occasions, it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement. For instance, if we discovered an error during your visit to our site that prevented you from completing a purchase, we might send you an email to let you know our site is back in service. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications and they are not promotional in nature. However, you may deactivate your account.
We employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and processing credit card payments. They have access only to the personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

After registration, you may also opt out of receiving communications from RayLen Vineyards by clicking the ”Unsubscribe“ link provided in our emails to you, emailing us erin@raylenvineards.com or by calling us at (336) 998-3100.
