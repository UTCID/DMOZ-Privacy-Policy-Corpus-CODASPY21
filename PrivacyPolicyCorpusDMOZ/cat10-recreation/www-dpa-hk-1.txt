Cookies
A cookie is a small text file which is placed on your device. Cookies help to analyse web traffic and allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Certain cookies may contain personal data – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie may store your username. Most cookies won’t collect personal data that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information, such as how users arrive at and use our Sites, or a user’s general location.
What do we use cookies for?
We may place cookies or similar files on your device for security purposes, to tell us whether you have visited the site before, to otherwise facilitate site navigation, and to personalise your experience while visiting our site. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our site and pages visited. Cookies also allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the site. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting the site. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better site by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your device or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
What kinds of cookies do we use?
Generally, the cookies that are used on the site can be broken down in to the following categories:
Session cookies
These cookies are used ‘in-session’ each time you visit and then expire when you leave a site or shortly thereafter: they are not stored on your device permanently, do not contain any personal data and help by minimising the need to transfer personal data across the internet. These cookies can be deleted or you can refuse to allow their use, but this will hamper the performance and your experience in using the Sites. These cookies also take time stamps that record when you access a site and when you leave a site.
Tracking cookies
These cookies enable us to recognise repeat visitors to our site. By matching an anonymous, randomly generated identifier, a tracking cookie keeps track of where a user of our site came from, what search engine they may have used, what link they clicked on, what keyword they used and where they were in the world when they accessed a site. By monitoring this data, we can make improvements to our site.
Persistent cookies
This type of cookie is saved on your device for a fixed period (sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for a year or longer) and is not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where we need to remember who you are for more than one browsing session. For example, this type of cookie can be used to store your preferences, so that they are remembered for the next visit to a Site.
Performance or analytical cookies
Performance cookies are used to analyse how the site are used and to monitor their performance, which allows us to improve your experience in using the site. These cookies help us to tailor the content of the site to reflect what the site users find most interesting and to identify when technical issues with the site arise. We may also use this data to compile reports to help us to analyse how the site is used, what the most common issues are and how we can improve the site.
Can the cookies be blocked?
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) to disable existing cookies; or (iii) to set your browser to automatically reject any cookies. However, please be aware that if you disable or reject cookies, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognise and associate you with your DPA account. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
