Trail Policy
A key part of our mandate is to be the Ontario voice of trail owners, organizations and trail users, whether they are groups or individuals.
Although virtually everyone agrees that trails bring us numerous health, recreational,
environmental and economic benefits, we still require an advocacy role to ensure that our
perspective is heard, especially at various levels of government.
In today's society, there are many competing priorities for land use and access rights. The Ontario Trails Council brings credibility and recognition to trail issues and speaks with a united voice where advocacy is required.
One of the primary areas where the OTC has had real influence in in that of land managment issues. Click on the links below for information on land managment solutions and ideas we've presented over the years.
