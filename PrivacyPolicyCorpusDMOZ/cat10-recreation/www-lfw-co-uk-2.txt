Making a purchase couldn't be easier
Just browse our range, click on any items that you wish to buy and add them to basket. After you have finished your selection, click on "Secure Checkout" and you will be asked for a few details that we need to be able to satisfy the order. You may also place your order over the phone. Orders are then processed with all possible speed, usually the same day. All orders must be paid for before despatch.
Age
You must be 18 years of age or over to order any of our products that contain alcohol. We will only deliver to those aged 18 or over and purchases must not be made on behalf of, or for onward supply to, persons under 18 (UK). It is the responsibility of any customers who access the website from outside the UK to be compliant with local laws, including licensing laws. Loch Fyne Whiskies cannot be held responsible for this.
Duty and Tax
For orders made from the UK or the European Union, the prices will include Excise Duty and VAT at the rates currently applied in the UK, where appropriate. All orders beyond the EU are VAT free, though local import taxes and fees may be charged in the country of delivery and are payable by the recipient before the courier will deliver. We ask that you satisfy yourself about these local taxes before placing your order as Loch Fyne Whiskies will take no responsibility for these.
Pricing
Our prices are believed to be accurate and up to date but we reserve the right to change prices at any time until the goods are despatched. Our prices apply only to goods bought from this website and not the Loch Fyne Whiskies shop in Inveraray where prices may be different from time to time.
All prices on this site are considered an invitation to treat rather than an offer for acceptance by any purchaser.
Our prices do not include postage and packaging. This will be added to your basket at the checkout stage.
Our products are listed subject to availability.
If we show a promotional price on a product, then that product will have been available previously at a higher price on our website or in our shop in Inverarary.
Delivery
We rely solely on the delivery destination information supplied by you at the time of placing the order and we make no further checks. Delivery is made by a third party tracked courier service and their Terms and Conditions apply. If our couriers attempt delivery in accordance with their Terms and Conditions but are unsuccessful, they may return the parcel to their depot or local Post Office. It may then be returned to us. If returned to us and undamaged, you may apply for a refund less our courier's costs for returning the parcel to us.
Goods are despatched entirely at the customer's own risk. We will take all reasonable care to ensure that your goods are securely wrapped and protected from damage.
Privacy
Loch Fyne Whiskies is committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure. We will not disclose your information to third parties other than when order details are processed as part of the order fulfilment and delivery process or unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so all as more fully detailed in our Privacy Policy.
