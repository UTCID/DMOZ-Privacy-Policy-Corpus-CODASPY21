Holiday Gift GuideRead MorePrivacy Policy
Effective September 28, 2017
PetPlace.com values its relationship with you. Like you, we understand the importance of privacy. Protecting the privacy of your information is of great importance to us. We do not sell your information such as email address, but we may share your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
This policy describes how PetPlace collects, uses, and shares information about you and applies to your use of our website located at www.petplace.com as well as any online service location that posts a link to this Privacy Policy and all features, content, and other services that we own, control and make available through such online service location (collectively referred to as “Service” hereafter). This includes when you sign up for a newsletter, take advantage of offerings that may be presented from time to time, participate in contests or surveys, or other activity in which you engage the Service.
The Information We Collect and Its Use
Information Provided by You
PetPlace and our agents, vendors, consultants, affiliates, and other service providers (collectively “Service Providers”) may collect information you provide directly via the Service. For example, we and our Service Providers collect information from you in order to provide you with the information you request from us such as category specific newsletter, or to verify a comment you make to content we post, or to respond to an inquiry you make of us on the Service. We and our Service Providers may ask you to provide personal information when you comment on an article of content, request information, sign up to receive our newsletters, or sign up to receive offers from third parties partnering with the Service.
The Information we collect may include Personal Information. Personal Information is information that can be associated with a specific person and used to identify that person (whether alone or in combination), such as first and last name, postal address, email address, telephone number, among other personally identifiable information. We may also collect details about your pet(s). Personal information does not include information that has been “de-identified” so that it cannot reasonably be linked to a specific individual.  Personal Information, once “de-indentified” is not subject to this Privacy Policy and we and our Service Providers may treat it as non-Personal Information and use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law.
Information Collected Automatically
You may browse our website at www.petplace.com  anonymously and find information about pet health, breeds, pet insurance, pet products or other related information as may be available on the site. We, and our Service Providers, may automatically collect information about you when you access or use the Service (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, data regarding network connected hardware, and information about your use of the Service. To the extent that we combine Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:
Log Information: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, which is stored in log files.
Information Collected by Tracking Technologies: Cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, device fingerprinting, in-app tracking methods, and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“Tracking Technologies”) may be used to collect information about your interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and activity behavior.
Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be a session ID cookie or tracking cookie. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies help in understanding how you use the Service, and remain longer. The Service may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your devices. Cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time.
Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”). Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “internet tags” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies. GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location.
Device Fingerprinting.  Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, data regarding network connected hardware, and information about your use of the Service. To the extent that we combine Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services.

Third Party Service, Features and Devices

In addition, our Service contains features that allow you to interact with, connect to, or access our Service through certain Third Party Services and third party devices (“Third Party Features”). For example, you use a Third Party Feature when you access an insurance provider through a hyperlink on our Service. Remember that third parties may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you. Also, if you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature.

For example, analytics services such as Google Analytics, may use Tracking Technologies on our Service to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and provide other services relating to the Service activity and internet usage. Similarly, ad service services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Service (“Internet-based Advertising”).
