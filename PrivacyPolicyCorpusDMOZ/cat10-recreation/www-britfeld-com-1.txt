Weis Ways Newsletter
If you choose to subscribe or you have been subscribed to WEIS
WAYS Newsletter, I will have you email address. Oh Dah! If I find out that
anyone who has subscribed or has been subscribed to WEIS WAYS Newsletter is a
minor, under 13 years of age, I will delete their email address and put a block
on it.
My Guestbook - now disabled
If you choose to leave a message in my Guestbook, you do so
knowing that any details you leave there can be viewed by anyone who visits my
site. Another Dah! And anyone can use your details as they wish. I, however will
not abuse your details. My Guestbook is a moderated one. What this means for you
is; I check all entries and choose to activate or delete entries made. If I find
out that a minor has made an entry into my Guestbook it will not be activated.
If I find out, after activation of an entry, that it was submitted by a minor, I
will delete it. Full stop, no correspondence will be entered into and my
decision is final. (My Guestbook has been disabled until the new version
hiccups have been resolved)
Tell a friend your visit here was worthwhile
If you choose to use this form, I will have your email address
and I will also have your friends email address.
Weis-Awards Program - no longer in operation
Should you choose to submit a site to my award program, you
will be required to fill out a form which asks for certain information. All the
fields on this form are 'required', therefore in doing so I will have the
information you submit.  I will only use this information in relationship to my
Weis-Awards Program and nothing else, unless you otherwise state.
E-mail correspondence
Any email correspondence with me will automatically reveal your
email address to me. That shouldn't be news to anyone, but just in case. I will
only know what you disclose to me in such correspondence. Persons who supply me
with their telephone numbers will only receive telephone contact from me with
information regarding their request/s.
Snail-mail correspondence
If you write me and choose to place a return name and address
on the envelope and/or the letter you wrote, I will have that information. Along
with anything else you choose to disclose. That's pretty obvious. You will only
receive the information for which you provided me your name and address. Persons
who supply me with their telephone numbers will only receive telephone contact
from me with information regarding their request/s.
The information I collect is used to improve the content of my
Web Site. I will not, knowingly, share your information with other
organisations/individuals under any circumstances.
If my information practices change at some time in the future I
will post the policy changes to my Web Site to notify you of these changes. If
you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at
my Web Site periodically.
If you feel that this site is not following its stated
information policy, you may contact me at the above addresses or phone
number.
In the pursuit of excellence there can be no compromise.
