I won't knowingly and willingly
sell or give out data on individual users.
Period.
Aggregate data may be disclosed.
My web server logs hits to the pages, including IP address,
referring page, page visited and date.
Some logs may stay

Cookies
I make minimal use of cookies, but some applications I run,
such as Drupal for the blog on ideas.4brad.com do generate
cookies to recognize users.
There are 3rd party embedded frames
I include material from advertising networks, such as Google
