Pelican Parts, LLC - Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 6th, 2020
Your privacy is important to Pelican Parts, LLC (“Company”, “we”, “us”). This
privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how Company collects, uses, and discloses
information through its websites, platform, mobile applications and other
online services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”)
or otherwise interact with us. If you obtain your use of the Services in
connection with the services offered by a third party, the individual terms of
that third party’s contract with us and its own privacy policy may differ from
what is described in this Policy.
Changes to This PolicyWe may change this Policy from time to time. If
we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “last updated” date
above. If there are material changes to this Policy and you have an active
account with us, we will notify you more directly. We encourage you to check
this Policy whenever you use any of Services to understand how your personal
information is used.
Information CollectedWe collect information from you in various ways
when you use our Services. We may also supplement this information with
information from other companies. We collect two general types of information:
personal information and aggregate data. As used in this Policy, the term
“personal information” means information that specifically identifies an
individual (such as a name and email address), and demographic and other
information when directly linked to information that can identify an
individual.
Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate data”.
Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services
or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other
words, no personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data
helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider
new features or otherwise tailor our Services.
The following are the specific types of information we collect from you:
Information You Give Us. We collect information you give through our
Services, and when you register for and use our Services. Examples include the
following:
Registration and Contact Information. When you register to use
our Services or update your profile, we may collect various kinds of
information about you including, your name and email address; shipping
address; company name, company title, and other profile information you
provide; demographic information; and information you upload like photos.
Device and Activity Information. When you use your mobile device
with the Services, data recorded on your mobile device about your activity is
transferred from your mobile device to our servers. This data is stored and
used to provide the Service and is associated with your account. We also
collect information about any rehabilitee protocols you may be using.
Payment and Shipping Information. If you choose to order a product
through the Services, our payment processing vendor collects your payment card
information and billing address, and your shipping address and other contact
details, such as email address and phone number, may also be collected.Submissions and Company Services.
From time to time we may use surveys, contests or sweepstakes requesting
personal or demographic information and customer feedback. If you choose to
order a product through the Services, you may post a Product review.
Automatically Collected Information. We automatically receive certain
types of information when you interact with our Services. For example, it is
standard for your web browser to automatically send information to every web
site you visit, including ours. That information includes your computer’s IP
address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring web site
addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system
you use, your account activity, and files and pages accessed or used by you.
Cookies and Web Beacons. We may also use certain kinds of technology
such as cookies and web beacons to collect information. Among other things, the
use of cookies and web beacons enables us to improve our Services and emails by
seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of
computers accessing our web site, to personalize and improve your experience,
to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our Services without
re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount of data
which is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your
computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the
default setting. You can modify your browser setting to reject our cookies or
to prompt you before accepting a cookie by editing your browser options.
However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a
cookie, some portions of the web site and services may not function properly.
For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain web page
features or services. A web beacon is an electronic image, also called a "gif,"
that may be used on our web pages to deliver cookies, count visits and compile
statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness or in our emails to tell if an
email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies and
how to disable them, please see "Choices/Opt-Out" below.

transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to
inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we
