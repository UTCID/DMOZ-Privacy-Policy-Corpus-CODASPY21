Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
The California State Attorney General may issue guidance on if the use of advertising and analytics cookies on our websites may be considered a “sale” of personal information as the term “sale” is broadly defined in the CCPA. Until such guidance has been issued, we will consider it a “sale” in order to be as transparent as possible with users of our websites and will comply with the restrictions of the “sale” of this information to the extent technologically feasible. In the preceding twelve (12) months, Beam Suntory has “sold” the following categories of personal information:
Category F: Internet or other similar network activity.
We may sell your personal information to the following categories of third parties:
Internet cookie information recipients, such as analytics and behavioral advertising services.
You have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”).
To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting our Websites and clicking on the “Do not sell my personal information” link in the footer. Please note you must do this on each of the respective websites you wish to opt-out from.
Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, we may not recognize you to comply with your opt-out request if you use a different device to interact with us or if you clear the cookies on your mobile device. You may change your mind and opt back into the sale of your personal information at any time by visiting our website and clicking on the “Do not sell my personal information” link in the footer. Please note you must do this on each of the respective websites you wish to opt-in to.
You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
