You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for USBDT to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from USBDT, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the USBDT Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of USBDT membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new USBDT properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that USBDT assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.  YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are 21 years of age, have capacity to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or USBDT has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, USBDT has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).

Without limiting the foregoing, USBDT and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by USBDT or submitted to USBDT, including without limitation information in USBDT Message Boards and in all other parts of the Service. You acknowledge, consent and agree that USBDT may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of USBDT, its users and the public. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service may include security components that permit digital materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by USBDT and/or content providers who provide content to the Service. You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Service. Any unauthorized reproduction, publication, further distribution or public exhibition of the materials provided on the Service, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.  INTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON USBDT NETWORK When you register with USBDT, you acknowledge that in using USBDT services to send electronic communications (including but not limited to email, search queries, sending messages to USBDT Forums or USBDT Teams, uploading photos and files to USBDT, and other Internet activities), you will be causing communications to be sent through USBDT's computer networks, portions of which are located in Maryland, and other locations in the United States and portions of which may be located abroad. As a result, and also as a result of USBDT's network architecture and business practices and the nature of electronic communications, even communications that seem to be intrastate in nature can result in the transmission of interstate communications regardless of where you are physically located at the time of transmission. Accordingly, by agreeing to this Terms of Service, you acknowledge that use of the service results in interstate data transmissions.  SPECIAL ADMONITIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL USE Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.  CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON THE SERVICE USBDT does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for inclusion on the Service.

By way of example, publicly accessible areas of the Service would include USBDT Message Boards and portions of USBDT Groups, Photos and Briefcase that are open to both members and visitors. However, publicly accessible areas of the Service would not include portions of USBDT Groups that are limited to members, USBDT services intended for private communication such as USBDT Mail or USBDT Messenger, or areas off of the USBDT network of properties such as portions of World Wide Web sites that are accessible via hypertext or other links but are not hosted or served by USBDT. CONTRIBUTIONS TO USBDT By submitting ideas, suggestions, documents, pictures, videos, audio recordings and/or proposals ("Contributions") to USBDT through its suggestion or feedback webpages, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) your Contributions do not contain confidential or proprietary information; (b) USBDT is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Contributions; (c) USBDT shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use or disclose) such Contributions for any purpose, in any way, in any media worldwide; (d) USBDT may have something similar to the Contributions already under consideration or in development; (e) your Contributions automatically become the property of USBDT without any obligation of USBDT to you; and (f) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from USBDT under any circumstances.  INDEMNITY You agree to indemnify and hold USBDT and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, partners and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another.  NO RESALE OF SERVICE You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service (including your USBDT ID), use of the Service, or access to the Service.  GENERAL PRACTICES REGARDING USE AND STORAGE You acknowledge that USBDT may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum number of days that email messages, message board postings or other uploaded Content will be retained by the Service, the maximum number of email messages that may be sent from or received by an account on the Service, the maximum size of any email message that may be sent from or received by an account on the Service, the maximum disk space that will be allotted on USBDT's servers on your behalf, and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) you may access the Service in a given period of time.
