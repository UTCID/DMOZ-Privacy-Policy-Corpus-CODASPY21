About usOur MissionWhat is an argonaut?What is an adventure?What is a hero?Who is Scott?PartnersPress roomAdvertise hereDuring the California gold rush in 1849, the miners were nicknamed argonauts; and,
coincidently during California's second gold rush, the dotcom boom, The Argonauts Inc. was born in San Francisco exactly 150 years later. In 2019, we celebrate twenty years online, outlasting millions of other websites, and we still rank in the top few percent of billions.This website runs on renewable energy, and the books are produced from certified sustainable forests. Scott has paid for this website and volunteering by years of hard work as a graphic designer. But now that money is gone and we are running on a shoestring budget. Please donate to help with our cost, or to fund a school visit or Make-A-Book Project and book donations. Thanks for your help.
