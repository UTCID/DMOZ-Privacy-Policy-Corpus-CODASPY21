The security of your personal information is very important to
us. We utilize commercially reasonable information security standards to
protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or
disclosure. Northstar supports online security using appropriately secure
technology because we want your data to be safe. We bind our employees and
data processors to written agreements to observe your privacy and
confidentiality rights. Unfortunately, no method of internet transmission is
one hundred percent secure. While we strive to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its security.

Northstar will retain your personal information only for as
long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, or as required
or permitted by law, and then will delete it as required by law. For example,

agreements, cooperate with law enforcement requests or to meet other legal
obligations. We may also retain log files for internal analysis purposes,
though we would retain them for only a brief period except in cases where we
are legally required to retain them for longer periods, and in cases where
they are used for site safety and security or to improve website
functionality.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Northstar operates on a global basis. By using our products and
services you understand and agree that your personal information may be
transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA, which comprises the European
Union countries plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) to a country that does
not have an equivalent level of data protection, such as the United States.
When your personal information is transferred from your home country to
another country, the laws and regulations that protect your personal
information may be different than those in your home country. In particular,
if your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government
authorities in accordance with US law.
To the extent that Northstar is deemed to transfer your
personal information outside the EEA, Northstar relies upon data transfer
agreements with Model Contract Clauses, which the European Commission has
adopted to provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred
outside the EEA. You may obtain a copy of the Model Clauses by contacting privacy@ntmllc.com.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
The only personal information Northstar collects, processes and maintains is business information in which you have communicated with us concerning a business transaction, asked us to perform a service or provide you with a product, or which is otherwise excluded from the definition of personal information and most of the requirements with regard to that information within the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The business basis for, and the manner in which, such business information is collected and processed is set forth within this Privacy Notice.
Northstar does not sell personal information as the terms sell or sale are defined within CCPA.
Northstar only shares the information it collects with business partners who are its service providers and sharing information in this way is not a sale as that term is defined in the CCPA.
Service providers are business partners who perform business functions for Northstar, as the term Service Provider is defined within CCPA. They agree to use information only for these business purposes and not to redisclose it except as permitted or required by law as set out in our contracts with them. The nature of the services provided by these business partners and a description of the categories of these service providers is set forth within this Privacy Notice.
If you have questions regarding collection and sharing of your business information or believe that information that identifies you and has been collected and shared by Northstar is not business information within the meaning of CCPA or is not provided to a service provider as stated above, and you wish to advise us of these beliefs and ask that we not share that information please contact privacy@ntmllc.com
UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we do, we
will change the "effective date" at the top of the Privacy Policy.
Before making any update that would make this Privacy Policy materially less
restrictive in our use or disclosure of personal information collected prior
to the update, we will provide prior notice of the update by posting notice
on our Website at the top of the then-current Privacy Policy within a
reasonable time before the effective date of the update. We encourage you to
periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about our
collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.
