In addition, we may use web beacons (also known as 'action tags' or 'one pixel.gif files'), provided by our advertising serving partner, to measure the effectiveness of, and otherwise manage, our online advertising.

In addition, we may require that you provide your Payment Data to our third party service provider in order to process your Transaction ("Payment Processor"). In such instance, our Website provides a channel through which you provide your Payment Data directly to the Payment Processor; we do not store, access, process or transmit such Payment Data on your behalf.
Finally, Frontier Airlines also may use your Transaction Information and/or Usage Information to identify and develop products and services that may be of interest to you and/or share this information with certain third parties for direct marketing purposes with respect to special offers, products, services, programs, promotions, surveys, publications, invitations, or other opportunities that may be of interest to you.
