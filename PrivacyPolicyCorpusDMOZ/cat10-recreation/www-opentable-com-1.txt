INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE
“Personal information” is data that
identifies, relates to, describes, can be used to contact, or could reasonably

·
Other information you may provide (including
other information you provide about yourself or others through our Services or
to which you provide us with access via third-party platforms)
You may choose not to provide some of the
personal information described above. Please note, however, that many of our
Services require some personal information to operate, so if you choose not to
provide the personal information necessary to operate and provide you with a
particular Service or feature of that Service, you may not be able to use that
Service or feature.
We do not proactively collect sensitive personal
information, such as health-related information. However, our Services include
text boxes that are designed for you to describe certain details about your
dining preferences that you want us or restaurants to know. Please be aware
that information you freely submit in these boxes may reveal to us or to the
restaurants or restaurant affiliates with which we or they share information
(as detailed in the How We Share Your
Information section, below) certain information that may be considered
sensitive personal information under applicable law (for example, about any
allergies or dietary restrictions). We do not use this information for the
purpose of marketing or advertising products to you. Sensitive personal
information you voluntarily submit is processed on the basis of your consent,
which you may revoke at any time by contacting us at the details set out in the
How to Contact Us section below.
Personal
Information Generated By Us. As you use our
Services, we generate certain personal information about you, including through
automatic data collection and by inferences based on the information we collect
about you and your activity.  We may
automatically collect information about your interactions with the Services or
communications you receive (such as email) using certain technologies, such as
cookies, web beacons and other technologies (see our Cookies
and Interest-Based Advertising Policy for more details). We generate the
following categories of personal information about you:
·
Device information. When you visit or
use our Services, we automatically collect certain information about your
device (e.g., your mobile device, computer, or tablet), including information
about your hardware and software, device configuration, and nearby networks.
Such data may include data about your device operating systems, browsers, and
other software installed on your device; device identifiers, such as IP address,
IMEI number, MAC address, or other device identifier; country of origin, region
and language settings; and information about domain servers and wireless or

Location information. If you use our
Services, we automatically collect generic location information about you (such
as city or neighborhood) or, with your
consent, precise geographic location data from your mobile device when the app
is running and when it is not running, depending on the
choices you make when you are asked to consent to our collection of location
information. For example, we may receive this information when you select
restaurant search locations, enter your local dining city in your account
profile, when you are in proximity to certain beacons, choose to publish your
location in reviews you leave for restaurants on the Services, or in your
comments or other communications with us. We may use and store this information
to provide and improve features of our Services, for example, to tailor our
Services on a needs-based manner to better facilitate your requests and to
provide you with more relevant content about restaurants in your dining city or
cities you visit. Please see the Your Rights and Choices
section below for more information about how to adjust your preferences,
including those related to location information.
·
Inferences about you. We combine the
information we collect, generate, or otherwise obtain to draw inferences about your
preferences and interests in order to provide and personalize our Services and
tailor the offers we and our partners provide to you.
Personal
Information We Obtain from Third Parties. We may
also receive certain categories of personal information from third parties,
such as third-party websites, applications, social media networks, and services
(which may include publicly-available sources; each of these is a “third-party platform”), our group
companies, restaurants, and other third parties, including individuals who have
added you as a guest to their reservation. If you are an existing OpenTable
customer, we will combine this information with information we collect through
our Services and use and share it for the purposes described below. The categories
of personal information we may obtain from third parties include:
·
Your name

Email address or other contact information
·
Social media data, if you connect to our
Services using a social media third-party platform or interact with OpenTable
by liking or commenting on our social media pages or content, or if any of your
social media data is available to the public, we may receive information from
that social media third-party platform or a third-party service about those
interactions and your profile
·
Browsing, usage and advertising details, including how you use our Services and/or third-party websites,
applications, and services; and information relating to your interactions with
our advertising and marketing materials
·
Purchase Information, including

as items ordered, bill total, and time spent at the restaurant), information
about travel accommodations and bookings you make through our group companies
(for example, if you book a hotel stay through one of our group companies, we
may receive the general location of your accommodations and use that
information to provide nearby restaurant recommendations); or purchase
information for other business partners and affiliates, such as food delivery
partners
·
Information from restaurants, including
information that certain participating restaurants provide us about diners (for
example, if you eat at a hotel restaurant as a hotel guest, restaurants are
able to flag that you are a guest at that hotel, or if you eat at a chain of
restaurants, those restaurants can flag whether you have a loyalty card or
other information about interactions with those restaurants)
II.

of your account

Send you marketing communications,
including communicating with you about services or products offered by
OpenTable, our group companies, or our business partners and other marketing
communications that we believe you would be interested in, as permitted by law
(see below for more detail on Electronic
Communications and Your Choices and Rights)

services, including using analytics to better

Provide services, products, and information to restaurants, including restaurant groups and restaurant affiliates

Tailor your experience with our Services, such as by making inferences or combining different pieces of information
we have collected about you to suggest restaurants that you may be interested
in or otherwise tailor our Services to you according to your preferences or
restrictions. For example, if you frequently search for or book Italian
restaurants or restaurants with outdoor seating in your home city, we may
prioritize Italian restaurants with outdoor seating in your search results when
you look for reservations in another city
·
Provide you more relevant advertising on and off our Services, including to show you personalized offers on and off our Services.
For example, if you frequently search for or book reservations at Italian
restaurants in a particular city, we may display advertising for a local
Italian restaurant to you on our Services or work with our business partners to
display advertisements for local Italian restaurants to you on other websites
you visit
·
Protect against, investigate, and deter fraudulent, unauthorized, or
illegal activity

Comply with our policies, procedures and legal obligations, including complying with law enforcement or government authority
requests, addressing litigation-related issues, and exercising rights or

·
As otherwise consented to by you and as required or permitted by
applicable law. If you give your consent to any
further use of personal information, you can withdraw that consent at any time
by contacting us using the details set out below.
You have choices about your personal
information, and in some circumstances, you may have the right to opt-out or
object to our uses of your personal information for these Purposes. For more
information, or to exercise these or other rights (where available), see the Your Choices and Rights section below.
Electronic Communications. Consistent with the above Purposes and as permitted by applicable
law, we may communicate with you via electronic messages, including email, text
message, or mobile push notification to:
·
Send you information relating to our products and Services. This may include reservation and waitlist confirmations, reminders
and updates, receipts, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support
and administrative messages.
·
Send you marketing communications.  In other situations, subject to the Your Choices and Rights section below and applicable
law, we may communicate with you about contests, offers, promotions, rewards,
upcoming events, and other news about products and Services offered by OpenTable,

With your consent, where required, we may
contact you at the mobile phone number that you provide to us by way of direct
dial calls, autodialed and prerecorded message calls, text messages and push
notifications in connection with the above Purposes.
Our Role as Data Controller and Data Processor. For purposes of European Union law and similar data protection
regimes, we generally act as a data controller, meaning we determine the
purposes and means of processing your personal information through our
Services. Under certain OpenTable programs, however, restaurants may engage us
to provide them with certain processing services related to information owned
or controlled by the restaurant. We seek assurances from restaurants that they
will process information in accordance with applicable laws, but we are not
responsible for any restaurant's use of information (including information used
by its affiliates and service providers) for which it is an owner or controller.
To learn more about how a restaurant may use such information, you should
review its privacy notice.
Processing
Bases and Consequences. When we process your
personal information, we rely on the following legal bases:
·
Performance of the contract we have with you (such as if you use our Services to make a restaurant reservation,
we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and
administer your reservation by sharing your information with the appropriate
restaurant).
·
Compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject (such as tax obligations, and when we are obliged to comply with
lawful requests from competent authorities such as law enforcement).
·
To serve our legitimate interests (such
as tailoring your experience with our Services, carrying out online
advertising, and for fraud detection), provided that such processing does not
outweigh your rights and freedoms. The processing may also be pursuant to other
applicable legal bases for data processing especially provisions set out under
local law.
Where we use personal
information to meet our legitimate interests, we take steps to ensure that your
rights with respect to your personal information are not infringed. You can
contact us using the details set out in the How to
Contact Us section below for more information about the steps we take to
ensure these rights are not infringed. You also have the right to object to
such processing as described in the Your Choices and
Rights section below.
·
Consent. To the extent that a legal
ground described above would not apply to processing of your personal
information by us, we will seek your consent for such specific purpose in
accordance with applicable law (such as sending direct marketing messages by
electronic means, like email, without an exception from the requirement to
obtain consent).
Aggregate
Information. We aggregate personal information
collected directly from you, information generated about you by us, and
information obtained from third parties (with your consent, where required) with
personal information collected about other users in order to produce general
statistics that cannot be linked to you or any other specific user. Information
that has been aggregated and de-identified is no longer considered “personal
information” and may be subsequently used for any purpose.
Anonymized
Information. We may process information that cannot
be linked to you or any other specific user using any means available to us,
either because it was collected anonymously or has been subsequently
anonymized. Information that is anonymous or has been anonymized is no longer
considered “personal information” and may be subsequently used for any purpose.
III.
HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
We disclose the personal information we
collect (or otherwise generate or obtain) as follows:
·
With restaurants and restaurant affiliates. We share your information with restaurants and their affiliates to provide the Services (such as

account. If you use a third-party service or
application (e.g., Facebook) to log into your OpenTable account, we share
certain personal information with that third party, such as your name and email
address.
·
Reviews you submit. If you provide us
with a review of your restaurant reservation, you authorize us to publish it on
all our Services under the screenname you provided, to aggregate your review
with other reviews, and to share it with restaurants.
·
Messages and other communications you submit to restaurants. If you submit a message or other communication to a restaurant
through our Services, you authorize us to share your message or communications
with the relevant restaurant, and you authorize the restaurant to respond to
you through our Services.
·
To process payments. We require credit
or debit card information to make payments at certain restaurants, to secure
your reservation, purchase tickets to events, or purchase other products or
services, in which case we share your payment information with restaurants,
third-party payment processors, and other third-party service providers (such

who perform services or functions on our behalf (see below for more detail on Sharing with Other Service Providers).

In the event of a corporate transaction.
We may disclose or transfer your information to a third party if we sell,
transfer, divest, or disclose all or a portion of our business or assets to
another company in connection with or during negotiation of any merger,
financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction, or proceeding.
·
To protect rights and property. We may
disclose your information to third parties when we believe in good faith that
disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, our property, the integrity of
the Services, personal safety, or the interests of you or any other person, and
to detect, prevent and/or otherwise address fraud, risk management, security or
technical issues.
·

may disclose your personal information to government authorities or other
relevant third parties in order to comply with applicable legal requirements,
judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or lawful requests from

In some circumstances, you may have the
right to opt-out or object to our sharing of your information with certain third
parties. For more information, or to exercise these or other rights, see the Your Choices and Rights section below.
Sharing with Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates as a controller of your
personal information. When you make a request
through our Services or through a restaurant, such as a restaurant reservation,
joining a restaurant waitlist, making a payment to a restaurant through our
Services, purchasing an event ticket, or if you are a guest of the person making
the request, we necessarily provide certain categories of your information to
the restaurant to facilitate that request. For requests to dine, this
information may include your name, profile, time and date of visit, party size,
your phone number, your dining preferences, guest information, any special
requests, information or comments that you choose to submit (if any), and your
email address. Your information is provided to the restaurant, just as it would
be if you contacted the restaurant directly. If you provide a mobile phone
number in connection with your request, restaurants may send you text messages
regarding your request. Some restaurants also require you to provide credit or
debit card account information to secure your reservation. When you make a
reservation at a restaurant that is part of a restaurant group, we may also
share additional information about your dining activity at that restaurant or
restaurant group in the past, your dining preferences and/or information that
we collect from you and third parties that may be relevant to that reservation.
In addition to providing you with more
customized Services, we may receive certain information from participating
restaurants from their Point of Sale terminals that we analyze to provide
aggregate information to the restaurant about their customers.
We also share with restaurants summary
reports of feedback from diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant
through our Services, these comments may be shared with or may be accessible by
that restaurant, and the restaurant may respond to you. We will not tie your
comments with other information that can identify you directly, but a
restaurant may be able to tell who you are from your comments, particularly if
you give your name in the comments or provide contact information, such as an
email address.
Sharing
with Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates as a processor or service provider
on their behalf. We act as a processor or service
provider for Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates in certain circumstances as
described above (see above for more detail on Our Role as Data Controller and Data
Processor). In providing these services, we may, at the direction of the
restaurant, share certain of your information with the restaurant’s affiliated
restaurants (such as affiliated brands), restaurant group and/or restaurants
with the same brand or parent-brand (collectively, such restaurant’s “restaurant group”), or other entities
associated with the restaurant (such as the parent entity of the restaurant
group or affiliated hotels) and/or their service providers (collectively, the
associated entities and service providers, the restaurant’s "restaurant affiliates") under
OpenTable’s programs for the following purposes:
·
Customized services: restaurants may
share your information (such as meal or seating preferences or special
occasions) with their restaurant affiliates and restaurant group to enhance the
hospitality the restaurant group provides you when you dine with them (such as
trying to seat you by a window, if you previously expressed a preference for
window seating).
·
Operations & Service Improvements: to
support operations, improve the restaurant’s table and shift planning, improve
their hospitality services, including supporting a loyalty program you have
chosen to participate in.
·
Marketing: as permitted by applicable
law, to perform analytics and tailor marketing to you.
For more information, please feel free to
contact the restaurants with which you dine or book reservations, or contact us
using the contact information listed in the How to
Contact Us section below. To learn more about your choices related to how
we share your information with restaurant groups and restaurant affiliates
under our programs, please see the Your Choices and
Rights section below.
Sharing with Our Group Companies. We share
your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries in the U.S. and worldwide,
as well as with our parent corporation, Booking Holdings Inc., and its other
subsidiaries (collectively, as also defined earlier in this Privacy Policy, “our
group companies”). We may share your information with our group companies for
the following reasons:
·
Provide you with integrated
services (including to administer and manage reservations, purchases, services,
and payments across our affiliated platforms).
·
Provide personalized offers or
send you marketing communications with your consent or as otherwise permitted
by applicable law.
·
Enable “single sign-on”, i.e.,
allowing you to log into a shared account for multiple Booking Holdings Inc.
brands using a single set of log-in credentials, which allows us to, for example,
show your purchases and bookings made through the websites, applications, and
services of our group companies on your account page, and allows our group
companies to show information in your respective account(s) with them.
·
Provide customer support
services.
·
Detect, prevent, and
investigate fraud and misuse of our services, other illegal activities, and
data breaches.
·
Analyze how users use our
independent and affiliated platforms, including so that we may improve existing
products and services and develop new features, products, and services that may
be of interest to our users.
·
Ensure compliance with
applicable law.
To learn more about your choices related to
how we share your information with our group companies, please see the Your Choices and Rights section below.
Sharing with Our Business Partners. We share your information with other third-party business partners
for their own marketing purposes. These third parties include online
advertisers or ad tech companies, who may provide you with targeted advertising
and marketing communications, where permitted under law. The information we
share includes information collected through your use of our Services (e.g.,
bookings, reservations, or other purchases) and information we collect about
you through the use of cookies and similar technologies (e.g., information
about the websites you visit; information about your searches, including the
cities or neighborhoods you search in, the type of restaurant or cuisine you searched
for, price range, intended dining date, and the number of diners).
For example, if you
frequently book reservations at Italian restaurants, we use that information to
help a particular Italian-themed restaurant group offer you a promotion.
To learn more about your choices related to
how we share your information with our business partners, please see the Your Choices and Rights section below.
Sharing with Social Networking Services.   Our Services allow you to
connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or
with friends. Our Services may also allow you to connect with us on, share on,
and use third-party platforms, including those on which OpenTable has a presence.
Please be mindful of your personal privacy needs and the privacy needs of
others as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We
cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public
or share with others. OpenTable also does not control the privacy practices of
third-party platforms. Please contact those sites and services directly to
learn about their privacy practices.
Sharing to Process Payment Information. To use certain Services (such as to make reservations at certain
restaurants; to make payments to certain restaurants or to secure reservations;
and to purchase tickets to events, or other products or services), we require
credit or debit card account information. When you submit your credit or debit
card account information through our Services, we share that information with
restaurants, third-party payment processors, and other third-party service
providers (including, but not limited to, vendors who provide fraud detection
services to us and other third parties) to the extent necessary to meet our
contractual obligations to you (e.g., to secure your reservation or make a
payment to a restaurant where required), to meet our legitimate interests in
preventing fraud and other misuse of our platforms, or with your consent where
this is required by law. In particular:
·
When you use a credit or debit
card to secure a reservation through our Services, we provide your credit or
debit card account information (including card number and expiration date, but
excluding the CVV number) to our third-party payment service providers and the
applicable restaurant.
·
When you initially provide your
credit or debit card account information through our Services in order to use
our restaurant payment services, we provide your credit or debit card account
information to our third-party payment service providers. As explained in the
OpenTable Terms of Use, these third parties may store your credit or debit card
account information so you can use our restaurant payment services through our
Services in the future, to the extent permitted by local law.
·
For information about the
security of your credit or debit card account information, see the How We Store and Protect Your Information
section below.
Sharing with Other Service
Providers. We share information with third-party
vendors, consultants, and other service providers who perform services or
functions on our behalf (e.g., hosting or operating our Services, data
collection, reporting, ad response measurement, site analytics, data analysis,
delivering marketing messages and advertisements, processing credit card
payments, and providing fraud detection services). We do not authorize these
third parties to use or disclose your information for purposes other than for
which it has been provided. We require these third parties to maintain and
implement security measures to protect your information from unauthorized
access or processing.
IV.
HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
OpenTable maintains commercially-reasonable
technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect
your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration, and destruction.
When your credit or debit card account
information is being transmitted to our Services or through our Services, it
will be protected by cryptographic protocols. To be clear, OpenTable does not
itself store your credit or debit card account information, and we do not have
direct control over or responsibility for your credit or debit card account
information. We use third party payment processors that are the controllers of
your credit card information. Our contracts with third parties that receive
your credit or debit card account information require them to keep it secure
and confidential.
However, we cannot guarantee that
transmissions of your credit or debit card account information or your other
information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never
be able to defeat the security measures taken by OpenTable or our third-party
service providers. Except to the extent that liability cannot be excluded or
limited due to applicable law, we assume no liability or responsibility for
disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized
third-party access, or other causes beyond our control.
You play an important role in keeping your
information secure. You should not share your user name, password, or other
security information for your OpenTable account with anyone. If we receive
instructions using your user name and password, we will assume you have
authorized the instructions. If you have reason to believe that your
interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of
any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us
immediately as detailed in the How to Contact Us
section below.
Retention. We may retain your personal information for as long as your account
is active and for a period of time thereafter to allow you to re-activate your
account without loss of information. We may also retain your personal
information as necessary to:
Maintain
logs and business records for analysis, security, and/or audit purposes
Comply
with record retention requirements under the law
Deal with
any complaints regarding the Services; and
Comply
with our legal obligations, protect or defend our rights, resolve disputes
and enforce our contracts

receiving this information via the booking confirmation page or your OpenTable

Customized
Dining Experiences. As described in the Sharing with Restaurants and Restaurant
Affiliates section of the privacy policy - in Part III above, when you book
with restaurants we share your information with them to ensure your booking is
recorded. These restaurants may
share your dining information with their restaurant
affiliates or broader restaurant
group or through the OpenTable platform for the purpose of improving and
personalizing your dining experience on future visits  if you book at a restaurant affiliate or
within the same restaurant group.  You
can opt-out of such sharing with restaurant affiliates and restaurant groups
for customized dining experiences by changing your OpenTable account
preferences.
Please note that if you opt-out of this
sharing, we may continue to assist restaurants in sharing information with
restaurant affiliates and restaurant groups for them to use for other internal
purposes, such as their internal analytics.

marketing purposes;

information for their own marketing purposes.
