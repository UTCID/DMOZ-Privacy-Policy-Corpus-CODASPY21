Wine Club Terms & Conditions
Provenance Vineyard will ship your club wine selections directly to your home or office. No bills, no fuss, we simply charge the credit card provided on your application at the time of shipping. Please note that it is your obligation to notify Provenance Vineyard of any account changes 15 days before the beginning of a shipment month. Membership is ongoing and may be cancelled with a 15 day notice after receiving your second club shipment. Provenance Vineyard requests a two shipment minimum commitment to the wine club.
