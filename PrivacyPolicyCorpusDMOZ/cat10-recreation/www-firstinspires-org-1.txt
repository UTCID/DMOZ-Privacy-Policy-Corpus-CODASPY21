FIRST Privacy Policy
See also: Legal Notices
Last Review and Update:  May 8, 2020
FIRST takes your privacy seriously. As a nonprofit and a mission-driven youth-serving organization, we are compelled to understand who we are serving, how our programs are performing, and make improvements so that we can achieve our goals of making FIRST accessible to any youth who wants to be part of the fun, exciting and life-changing experience. Thus, we need to collect certain pieces of data from you to ensure we are meeting our goals and responsibilities as a youth-serving nonprofit organization.
This FIRST Privacy Policy describes how FIRST ("FIRST," "our," "we," "us,") collects and processes  personal data that users (“user,” “your,” or “you”) provide to us at any of our web sites where this Policy is posted (the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy also applies to personal data which FIRST obtains by other means, as described below.
Treatment of Data for Minor Youth
We are a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization and are exempt from compliance with the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  Nevertheless, we choose to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13, residing outside of the European Union, within the spirit of COPPA, and those residing in the European Union as provided by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Youth under the age of 13 are not permitted to create accounts or provide personal data on our Sites.
If we learn that we have personal data obtained directly from a child under 13 we will delete that data as soon as possible.
1.  Agreement to the Policy

If you do not agree to any of the Sites’ terms and conditions or this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use any of our Sites in order to avoid inadvertent data collection.  In the event you believe data was collected without your consent please see article 18 for instructions on how to contact us.

(FIRST does not collect race or ethnicity data from residents of the European Union.)
