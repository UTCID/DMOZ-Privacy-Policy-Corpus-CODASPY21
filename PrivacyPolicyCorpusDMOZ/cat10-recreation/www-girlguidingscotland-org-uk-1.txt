Any other information you share with us
This information may be collected from:

We sometimes also collect sensitive personal data, for example information about health, religion, sexuality, ethnicity, political and philosophical beliefs and criminal records. We normally only record this data where we have your consent. But sometimes we are permitted to do this in other circumstances, under data protection law. We may make a record that a person is in a vulnerable circumstance to make sure that we don’t send fundraising messages to them – by doing this we comply with charity law and the Code of Fundraising Practice.
If you are 14 and under
If you are under the age of 14, you must get permission from your parent or guardian before registering or giving us any information.
Why and how do you use my personal data?
Data helps us support and improve interactions with Girlguiding Scotland. Examples include:
We use marketing materials for the following:
Updates about Girlguiding Scotland’s work, including newsletters and other publications
Appeals and fundraising activities including requests for donations; information about legacy gifts, raising funds or taking part in a fundraising event, and updates on the impact that fundraising activities have had on our work
Information about events
Information about shop products
Volunteering information about how to support Girlguiding Scotland, along with updates about the impact of your work
We may also use your personal information to build a profile of your interests and preferences. This helps us send you only relevant and timely information. And building profiles helps us improve the experience our supporters have – if we understand their background we can make appropriate requests to those who may be willing and able to give more than they already do. This helps us raise funds sooner and more cost-effectively.
There’s other information we can use, which is publicly available in places like public registers. This can include listed directorships, typical earnings in a geographical area, information from the electoral roll, press reports and social media posts.
Can I change my consent?
Yes! You can withdraw your consent, unsubscribe from or update your marketing preferences at any time. Just use the details in the ‘get in touch’ section.
If you make changes to your consent, we will update your record as soon as we possibly can. Emails will be stopped immediately, but it may take up to 60 days for our systems to update and stop post being sent to you.
If you tell us you don’t want marketing, fundraising or campaign communications, you may still receive messages about transactions and services from other connections you have with us (as described below).
When is it legal to use personal information?
We need a lawful basis to collect and use your personal data under data protection law. The law allows for six ways to process personal data (and additional ways for sensitive personal data). Four of these are relevant to Girlguiding Scotland. We can use process information on the basis of:
Your consent (for example to send you direct marketing by email or SMS)
Your contractual relationship with us (for example to provide you with goods or services that you have purchased from us)
The necessity for compliance with a legal obligation (for example to process a gift aid declaration and carrying out due diligence on large donations)
Girlguiding Scotland’s legitimate interests
What does legitimate interest mean?
Personal data may be legally collected and used if it is necessary for a legitimate interest of the organisation using the data, as long as its use is fair and does not adversely impact the rights of the individual concerned.
When we use your personal information, we will always consider if it is fair and balanced to do so, and if it is within your reasonable expectations. We will balance your rights and our legitimate interests to ensure that we use your personal information in ways that are not unduly intrusive or unfair. Girlguiding Scotland’s legitimate interests include:
Charity governance. This includes delivery of our charitable purposes, statutory and financial reporting and other regulatory compliance purposes
Administration and operational management. This includes answering enquires, giving information and services, research, events management, administration of volunteers and employment and recruitment requirements. This involves sharing information with regional and local levels of Girlguiding Scotland.
Fundraising and campaigning. This includes administering campaigns and donations and sending direct marketing by post (and in some cases making marketing calls), sending thank you letters, analysis, targeting and segmentation to develop communication strategies and maintaining communication suppressions.
If you would like more information on our uses of legitimate interests or to change our use of your personal data please get in touch with us using the details in the ‘get in touch’ section.
How long do you keep my data?
Girlguiding Scotland keeps your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
We decide how long is appropriate to keep personal data. We do this by considering the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data; the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data; the purposes for which we process your personal data, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the legal requirements.
If you ask to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list to avoid sending you more unwanted messages.
Do you share personal data with other organisations?
We do not share or sell your personal information to third-party organisations for marketing, fundraising or campaigning purposes.
We share your personal information with relevant regional and local levels of Girlguiding Scotland to:
Administer your membership of Girlguiding
Manage your participation in Girlguiding and Girlguiding Scotland activities
Conduct market research so we can improve our offerings to you and as an organisation overall
Conduct evaluations to improve the quality of our offering
We also share personal information:
With data processors working on our behalf. For example, if you buy an item in our online shop, we use third parties to host systems and to process payments
Where we are required to by law, for example to law enforcement or regulatory bodies
Where it is necessary to protect the vital interests of an individual
If we have your consent
We may use third-party suppliers to manage events, campaigns or mailings for fundraising appeals; to carry out research surveys or for storage of your personal information on our behalf. You can find out more about the suppliers that we use by contacting us using the details in the ‘get in touch’ section
