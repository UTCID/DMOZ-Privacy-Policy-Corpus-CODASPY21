Crisis24 strives to collect, use, and disclose personal and other information in a manner consistent with applicable laws, and prides itself on upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices. Crisis24 complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and for the purposes of this Policy, the Accountability principle under Article 5 [2] of GDPR, which establishes responsibility for, and demonstrating compliance with, the GDPR primarily for Data Controllers. However, Crisis24 undertakes to adopt this principle as a Data Processor for our Clients (the Data Controller) as well as a Data Controller for our employees.
This Privacy Policy describes how Crisis24 collects, uses, and shares information in connection with our website at www.crisis24.com and www.worldaware.com (the “Sites”); our collective services including but not limited to those listed at this link: and including any listed mobile applications (the “Apps”); and the emails that we send to our customers (collectively, the “Services”). It also describes users’ choices regarding use, access and correction of personal information.

What Information Is Collected
Crisis24 Commercial Services
Crisis24 collects both Personal Information and Other Information when you register for or use the Services. Crisis24 does not collect any Sensitive Personal Information, known as Special Categories under GDPR, unless expressly directed to do so by your employer, whereby your employer would need to secure a lawful processing ground for such data. “Personal Information” is any information or set of information relating to an identified person or an identifiable person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. For example, Personal Information includes name, address, email address, employer’s company name, job title, phone or fax number, employee ID, travel itineraries, including emergency contact information and, if requested by a client, passport numbers. “Sensitive Personal Information” means Personal Information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, that concerns an individual’s health or sex life, criminal proceedings, or that is designated in writing by a third party as Sensitive Personal Information. “Other Information” is any information that is not Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Personal Information does not include information that is anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information.
For individuals residing in the European Union, where Crisis24 collects Personal Information directly from you, we will inform you about the type of Personal Information collected, the purposes for which we collect and use the Personal Information, and the types of non-agent third parties to which Crisis24 discloses or may disclose that information, and the choices and means, if any, Crisis24 offer individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Under these circumstances, notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide Personal Information to Crisis24, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Crisis24 uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or discloses it for the first time to a third party.
We collect Personal Information for the Crisis24 Commercial Services in the following circumstances:
You provide certain Personal Information to us when you: (a) register to use the Services, (b) order products and services from us, and (c) send email messages, submit forms, or send other information to us.
Crisis24 may obtain Personal Information about you from third parties. For example, we may receive data feeds, including your past, current, or future travel plans, from a travel agency, Global Distribution System (GDS) such as Sabre, or a data aggregator, such as itinerary aggregators in order to provide risk management services.
When you complete a profile form to obtain personalized Crisis24 reports, you are required to give your contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about Crisis24 services about which you have expressed interest. It is optional for you to provide additional Personal Information (such as health and activity information) and unique identifiers (in the case of employees), but doing so permits Crisis24 to provide a more report.
If you use our Apps, Crisis24 may request to collect information about the precise location of your device using GPS, WiFi, or cellular network signals from your device. Keep in mind precise location data cannot be collected unless you allow the app to use your terminal equipment location. In particular, our Mobile App collect precise location when you use the “Crisis” or “Check In” buttons or when you use the App to learn about information that is relevant to your current location. The app may collect precise location from your device on a real-time, continuous basis to inform you, and allow your organization to inform you, of incidents and threats near your current location. In addition, our Critical Trac® app may collect precise location from your device on a real-time, continuous basis for tracking purposes and when you use the “Panic” and “Check In” buttons. If you would like Crisis24 to stop collecting precise location from your device, please follow the instructions in the section below titled “The Choices Available to Users Regarding Collection, Use, Sharing, and Correction of Personal Information.”
In the event of a complaint, we may receive Personal Information about you from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.
We may collect Personal Information from you at other points on our Services that state that Personal Information is being collected.
We and our service providers may also collect Other Information when you use the Services. This may include your computer or device operating system and browser type, your Internet service provider, your domain name, your general geographic location, the website that you visited before the Site, the webpage visited, the content accessed, the time spent on the webpage and the link you used to leave the Site. Crisis24 and its partners collect this Other Information automatically through the use of cookies or similar technologies, such as Javascript, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature of the Crisis24 platform or our websites. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

• When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Site, the information that you submit will be made available to other users, and sometimes to the general public. For this reason, we recommend that you do not submit any Personal Information, including your full name, home address, phone number, other information that would enable other users to locate you, or financial or medical information on these areas of our Site. If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a registered user of our Services, you may request that we remove content that information that you post on our Services that personally identifies you. To obtain removal of such content or information, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information you would like removed to dataprotection@garda.com. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted, since the content or information may remain in our database, may remain visible in a manner that does not identify you, or may have been re-posted by another user. There may be other circumstances in which applicable laws do not require or allow removal even if requested.
In addition, Crisis24 may use and disclose Personal Information and Other Information as it believes reasonably necessary: to comply with applicable law or respond to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); in response to lawful requests by public authorities (such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements); to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of our Terms and Conditions, or in other circumstances in which Crisis24 has a good faith belief that its products or Services are being used in the commission of a crime or that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or to protect our rights and property.
Crisis24 may disclose Personal Information and Other Information to facilitate the financing, securitization, insuring, merger, sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets.
We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified information about users of the Services for any purpose, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Crisis24 Services.
Privacy Protections for Children
This Site and the Crisis24 Services are provided for adults only. The Site and the Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Site or Services.
The Choices Available to Users Regarding Collection, Use And Distribution of Personal Information and Other Information
You can control the collection, use, and sharing of your information by following the instructions stated below. Please note that if you provide any information to parties who provide services to our Site or Apps or to any other sites or apps you encounter on the Internet or otherwise (even if these sites are branded with our branding), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the Personal Information you disclose to them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing Personal Information to third parties.
• You have the right to access, amend or delete Personal Information we hold about you, and in some cases to object to the processing of your Personal Information or request your Personal Information to be provided to you in a portable form. For example, if your Personal Information changes, you would like to review or correct your Personal Information, or if you no longer desire our Services, you may correct, update, or remove your Personal Information at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at marketing@crisis24.com. Upon request Crisis24 will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
You are given the opportunity to ‘opt in’ to having your Personal Information used for purposes not directly related to our Services at the point where we ask for the information. For example, Crisis24 might want to use your information as part of future marketing campaigns.
You may also ‘opt out’ of receiving non-essential or promotional communications directly from Crisis24. If you no longer wish to receive our non-service-related mailings, you may opt out of receiving these communications by following unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each communication, replying to the email and placing “unsubscribe” in the subject line of the email, or emailing us at dataprotection@garda.com.
• Crisis24 may collect location information if you use a Crisis24 application on your mobile device. The iOS and Android (OS 6.0+) platforms will alert you the first time a Crisis24 app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. You may subsequently manage your location sharing preferences at any time with the iOS and Android (OS 6.0+) platforms by changing the Location Services settings on the device. Android (OS 5.1.1 and earlier) devices will notify you of the permissions that a Crisis24 app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. Some applications, such as the Worldcue® Mobile app may also permit you to modify location reporting (the transmission of your location information to our servers) from within the application Settings. Please note that the Services require your precise location for certain features to work properly.
What Kind of Security Procedures We Use to Protect the Loss, Misuse, or Alteration of the Information Under Our Control
Crisis24 takes commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical precautions to protect our users’ information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no system is 100% secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the information that we collect.
We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, consistent with applicable law.
Information for European Users
Crisis24 is GDPR compliant and committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively.
Crisis24 is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under GDPR, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Crisis24 complies with GDPR for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
In certain situations, Crisis24 may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
International Transfer
Crisis24 provides services globally so it may be necessary to transfer your Personal Information internationally. In particular, your Personal Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States and/or the United Kingdom and wherever you access Crisis24 provided services while you travel. You acknowledge that the data protection and other laws of other countries may provide a less comprehensive or protective standard of protection than those in your country or the country you are in while using our services. Where European or UK data protection laws apply, we use Standard Data Protection Clauses in line with the guidance from the Court of Justice of the EU.
