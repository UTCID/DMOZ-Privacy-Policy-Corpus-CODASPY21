12. ARBITRATION; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION IN NEW YORK; ATTORNEYS' FEES1. Any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof, or any use of the Website (including all commercial transactions conducted through the Website) ("Claims"), except for claims filed in a small claims court that proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, shall be settled by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its then governing rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, where applicable. In agreeing to arbitrate all Claims, you and Minor League Baseball waive all rights to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding involving any Claim. The arbitration shall be held in New York County, New York, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. This arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to and in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.2. Subject to the limitations set forth below in this Section 12.2, the arbitrator shall have authority to award legal and equitable relief available in the courts of the State of New York, provided that:A. The arbitrator shall not have authority to award punitive damages; andB. Any and all claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis only, and shall not be consolidated or joined with or in any arbitration or other proceeding involving a Claim of any other party. You and Minor League Baseball agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to arbitrate any Claim as a class action or in any other form other than on an individual basis.3. For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration: (a) the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within New York County, New York (the "Forum"), and the parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and Minor League Baseball waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.4. In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section 12, or initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under Section 12.3 other than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this agreement to arbitrate and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.5. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you permanently and irrevocably waive the right to bring any Claim in any forum unless you provide Minor League Baseball with written notice of the events or facts giving rise to the Claim within one (1) year of their occurrence.
