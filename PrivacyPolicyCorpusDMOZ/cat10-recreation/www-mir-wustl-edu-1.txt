My Privacy
Mission
Washington University health-care providers respect the confidentiality of our patients' health information by observing the highest standards of ethics and integrity.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which is the federal law commonly known as “HIPAA,” provides certain protections for any of your health information (PHI*) that can be specifically identified as yours.  HIPAA permits and our privacy practices allow us to use your individually identifiable health information or share it with another health care provider or an insurance company in the following circumstances:
To treat and care for you, including contacting you for appointment reminders
To obtain payment from you or your insurance company
In connection with our health care operations, which are operational activities typically carried out by health care providers, such as quality assessment and improvement, review and/or training of health care professionals, business planning, customer service, grievance resolution and other general administrative activities
HIPAA also allows us to use certain health information for the following activities:
For our fundraising purposes (You have the right to opt out of receiving those communications.)
When required by law
When permitted by HIPAA for activities including:
Public health and safety
Health oversight agencies for monitoring of the health care system
Law enforcement related to its criminal investigations
Judicial and administrative proceedings
Organ donation
For research (provided other precautions are taken regarding your information)
You are entitled to receive and review our legal Notice of Privacy Practices.  Click here to access a link to Washington University's Information Security and HIPAA Privacy offices. You may download a copy of our notice from  this site.
