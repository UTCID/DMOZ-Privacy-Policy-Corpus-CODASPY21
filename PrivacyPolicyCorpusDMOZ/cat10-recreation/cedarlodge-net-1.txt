The Lodge
ABOUT THE PROPERTY
Tucked in the shadow of the remote peaks of the Southern Alps of New Zealand, Cedar Lodge is a fly fishing and adventure lodge like none other, offering immaculately appointed accommodations well off the beaten path. Fly fishers in the know consider New Zealand the trophy trout capital of the world for good reason. With an illustrious reputation in its own right, and known for massive brown and rainbow trout and pristine, gin clear water, Cedar Lodge offers the ultimate opportunity to target trophy trout.
With more than 30 years of heli-fishing experience exclusively in the South Island region, the award-winning Cedar Lodge is considered the South Island’s premier fly fishing lodge. Eleven Experience is honored to work with Chris and Shauna Daughters during this transition, and to carry on the legendary tradition of Cedar Lodge.
Perfect for the angler and non-angler alike, Cedar Lodge guests can enjoy intimate tours of New Zealand’s most renowned wineries, helicopter assisted hiking, and, of course, world-class helicopter assisted fly fishing led by highly knowledgeable and experienced local guides. Our guided vacation packages are tailored to make you feel at home on the South Island while putting you in front of wild trout on New Zealand’s most picturesque and exotic waters.

COVID-19
Cedar Lodge is nestled away, in the rural valley of Makarora, otherwise known as the “timeless land” and considered a special place to the locals. It’s stunning and seemingly endless mountains, pristine waters, wildlife and serenity easily captivate anyone who visits. The lodge is easily accessible by car, charter plane via the Makarora airstrip, and helicopter. By placing the entire country on a strict lockdown, New Zealand has been successful in essentially eliminating the virus within its borders. For information on steps we are taking to protect the health and safety of our guests and employees, please visit our COVID-19 Update Page.

ANGLING
New Zealand trout are wild. Both rainbow and brown trout reside in the pristine waters near Cedar Lodge. In fact, it’s not unusual to see both species occupying the same pool or run. Almost all of Cedar’s fishing requires the angler and fishing guide to stalk the fish, locate their target, carefully prepare for the presentation of the fly, and anxiously anticipate the strike. Cedar Lodge’s fly out helicopter concession to Mt. Aspiring National Park affords anglers total mobility to access remote waters where the lack of other fishermen permits unencumbered angling and numerous fishing options.

Sleep
Guests are guaranteed sweet dreams in our four en suite bedrooms capable of comfortably sleeping eight adults total.

All four en suites feature furnishings that are carefully curated to build on the beauty of the landscape and create a tangible feel of the outdoors within the interior surroundings.

EAT & DRINK
Building on the evolving culinary traditions of the region, guests can expect elegantly rustic “Frontier Cuisine”, steeped in New Zealand’s history of European and Asian influences while incorporating increasingly more uniquely Kiwi farm to table ingredients and flavors.  Our expert chefs source local, seasonal ingredients, prioritizing sustainable and decidedly South Island dishes at every meal.  Additionally, all of our seasonal dishes pair beautifully with local Kiwi wines.
