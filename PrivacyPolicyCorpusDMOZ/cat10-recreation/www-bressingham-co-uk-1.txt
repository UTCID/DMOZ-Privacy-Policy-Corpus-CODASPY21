Bressingham will only collect personal information when we need it. The type of information we need from you will relate purely to contact information allowing us to communicate with you.

How we will protect the information about you?
We will apply appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure your personal information is secure.  For example, we have systems in place to ensure that access to personal information is restricted to authorised individuals on a strictly need-to-know basis.
When we need to share personal data with our contractors and third party suppliers, our relationships are governed by our contracts with them which include strict data sharing and confidentiality protocols.
To help us ensure confidentiality of your personal information we may ask you (and any of your representatives) security questions to confirm your identity when you call us and as may be necessary when we call you.
We will not discuss your personal information with anyone other than you, unless you have given us prior written authorisation to do so or where we have received a clear verbal instruction from you (as a one-off circumstance).
Who will we share your information with?
We never share personal information with other organisations for third-party marketing purposes.
Sometimes we will need to share personal information we hold about you with other organisations that we work with or who provide services on our behalf.  When sharing information we will comply with all aspects of current data protection law. All our data sharing relationships are governed by contracts which include strict data sharing and confidentiality protocols.
Where ‘sharing’ is in our ‘legitimate business interests’, we may share your information without seeking your consent first.  This may be with:
Police, HMRC and other relevant authorities.
We may also share information when required by law for example where ordered by the Court or to protect an individual from immediate harm.
What are your rights in relation to your data?
We are committed to upholding your rights in respect of your personal data.
The right to be informed
Through the provision of this and other privacy notices on the website, we will be open and transparent about how and why we use your personal information.
The right of access
You have a right to ask us what personal information we hold about you and to request a copy of your information. This is known as a ‘subject access request’ (SAR).
SARs need to be made in writing and we ask that your written request is accompanied by proof of your address and identity.
If you are seeking to obtain specific information (e.g. about a particular matter or from a particular time period), it helps if you clarify the details of what you would like to receive in your written request.
If someone is requesting information on your behalf they will need written confirmation from you to evidence your consent for us to release this and proof of ID (both yours and theirs).
We have 30 calendar days within which to provide you with the information you’ve asked for (although we will try to provide this to you as promptly as possible).
The right to rectification
You can ask us to rectify your personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete. Please help us to keep our records accurate by keeping us informed if your details change.
The right to erasure
The right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.  This is not an absolute right, and we will need to consider the circumstances of any such request and balance this against our need to continue processing the data.  Our response will also be guided by the provisions of our retention schedule.
The right to object
You can tell us you object to us processing your data to provide auction update emails.
You can specifically opt-out of emails at any time by following the link at the bottom of each email.
How long will you keep my data?
We only hold records during the period of our relationship and for a set period afterwards to allow us to meet our legal obligations, including resolving any follow up issues between us. If you opt out of email updates and newsletters your data is removed from processing immediately.
Please contact us if you would like any more information.
