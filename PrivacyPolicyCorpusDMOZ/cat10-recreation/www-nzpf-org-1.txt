Privacy Policy
This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for www.nzpf.org. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following:
What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
The primary purpose of information we collect is to verify your identity and the status of your membership. The required data that we collect is for this purpose. We also collect some optional data to help us provide better services. This may be information (like jump numbers or home dropzone) that helps us understand our membership better, or information (like license numbers) that is convenient to have printed on your membership card.
We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to verify identity and membership. NOTE: Scanning a QR code on your membership card could lead to the disclosure of personal information about you related to that card. By allowing your code to be scanned you are authorising us to disclose that information.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about events, skydiving related news, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Only people who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
We do not collect sensitive information such as credit card data. All payments are processed by secure payment processing services Payment Express or PayPal. Credit Card information is encrypted and sent directly to those organisations from your browser.
