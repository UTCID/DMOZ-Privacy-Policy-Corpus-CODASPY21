Nothing in this website is to be construed as a recommendation to use any product, process, equipment or formulation, or as an endorsement, certification or approval of any product, service, or company, unless specifically stated to the contrary by IBTTA.
LINKS
IBTTA makes no representations and provides no warranties whatsoever concerning third party sites. The fact that IBTTA has provided a link to a third party site does not constitute an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship or affiliation by IBTTA with respect to such third party site or its owners or providers or any products or services mentioned or offered at the third party site. IBTTA expressly disclaims any responsibility for the content, the accuracy of the information and/or quality of products or services provided by, advertised on, or sold through, all third party sites.
PRIVACY
IBTTA collects and utilizes different kinds of information from users of the website.
Like most websites, this one uses “cookies” for several legitimate purposes. These include remembering user IDs and passwords and differentiating between repeat and new users. It is the policy of IBTTA that data generated by cookies is used for internal purposes only (e.g., to improve the site and site-related services for users). The data compiled via cookies is considered confidential and will not be sold to entities outside of the organization.
IBTTA may ask for your address, phone number and/or email address when you place an order for a product or service, when you complete a survey, register for a conference, apply for membership, or on other occasions. In each case, the objective is to have your contact information so that IBTTA can serve you better. From time to time, IBTTA may use your address, phone number or email address to provide updates and other information that may be of interest to you. The email addresses of those who communicate via email and who register through the site are collected, but IBTTA does not currently sell any email addresses to any third party.
IBTTA may aggregate information on what pages users access, and this information is used to enhance online offerings information and services.
IBTTA also collects information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations. This information is kept confidential and, again, is used for internal purposes.
SECURITY
IBTTA has taken reasonable precautions to ensure that your transactions and personal information are safe. Your transactions with IBTTA are protected by Verisign 128 Bit SSL certificate, which is currently the highest industry-standard encryption system used across the Web.
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It is a system, which exists partly in your Internet browser and partly on our Web server computer. It encrypts (or encodes) your signals before sending them to our system using a special algorithm that is unique to IBTTA. We use the latest 128-bit encryption technology to ensure that your information is sufficiently scrambled.
