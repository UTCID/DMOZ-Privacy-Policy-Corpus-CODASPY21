Cookies Policy
This Cookies Policy explains how Genting Hong Kong Limited and its subsidiaries, collectively “GHK”, “we”, “us”, “our”, and our corporate affiliates use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites on which this Cookies Policy is posted and that are GHK-branded or operated by GHK.
