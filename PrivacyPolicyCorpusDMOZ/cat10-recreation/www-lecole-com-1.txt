STATE LAW LIMITATIONS

We may, at our discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household, or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by the same account and/or the same credit card, or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.

All states allowing alcohol shipments to consumers require a signature, at the time of delivery, from a person of legal drinking age. Proof of age must be produced. We comply with all federal, state, and local laws regarding sale of alcohol to minors. If applicable, please see our Shipping & Service Policy for more details.

Prices and availability of products and services are subject to change without notice.

If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge. Individual bank policies will dictate when this amount is credited to your account.
