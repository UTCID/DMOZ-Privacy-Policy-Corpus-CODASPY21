to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in the Terms and Conditions, and to abide
by and comply with the Terms and Conditions.

Notice — From time to time, we may revise these Terms and Conditions. To help you stay current of any changes, Anheuser-Busch
may take one or more of the following steps: (1) Anheuser-Busch notes the date the Terms and Conditions was last updated above, and (2) when Anheuser-Busch
makes a material change to the Terms and Conditions, we may post conspicuous announcements of such changes on the Platform next to the link to

revised Terms and Conditions. Anheuser-Busch strongly recommends checking the Terms and Conditions periodically.If we are required by law to obtain

Binding Arbitration – Any controversy or claim arising out of your use of the Platform, these Terms and Conditions, and/or our
Privacy Policy shall be settled by binding arbitration before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), in a location determined
by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for claimant), or at such other location as may
be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the procedural rules for commercial disputes set forth in the Comprehensive Arbitration
Rules and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”) then prevailing, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures.Please go to www.jamsadr.com
to see a complete copy of the JAMS Rules and Procedures or to submit a claim for arbitration.
In resolving a claim for arbitration, the arbitrator shall apply Missouri law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of
limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration
will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration
as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to
be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts
with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed
in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion
that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class, representative, or collective basis, or as a
private attorney general on behalf of other persons similarly situated, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void,
and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitrate the dispute. Upon filing a demand for arbitration, all parties to such arbitration shall
have the right of discovery, which discovery shall be completed within sixty days after the demand for arbitration is made, unless further extended
by mutual agreement of the parties. Disputes regarding the arbitrability of any claim shall be resolved by the arbitrator.
THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU MAY NOT BRING ANY CLAIM AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS.THE
ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.
BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO
APPEAL. DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.
Miscellaneous — Anheuser-Busch’s failure to enforce any provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed a waiver of
such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. A printed version of the Terms and Conditions and of any notice given in electronic
form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms and Conditions to the same extent and subject
to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
