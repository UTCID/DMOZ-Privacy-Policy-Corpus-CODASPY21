(SP) – Kevin Durant has won the first championship of his nine-year NBA career, completing silencing all those who said the NBA superstar simply didn’t have what it takes to go to a 73-9 team and make them a little bit better.
“That’s for all the haters,” Durant complained after the final seconds ticked away in Golden State’s Game 5 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. “I won an NBA title with the Dream Team. Any questions now? Yeah, didn’t think so.”
Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said he was happy to see Durant get a ring.
“So many people doubted he could win a title here,” said Kerr. “Well, maybe not so many. There might have been a guy on Twitter or something. Some lonely, pathetic guy. But that guy, if he exists, looks pretty stupid now, huh?”
Durant said now that he has won a championship with the Warriors, he is now motivated to take on other challenges.
“I’m going to reach up and get something off of a high shelf,” said Durant. “I won’t let anyone tell me I can’t do it either.”
