What Are People Saying About Us?
Wonderful experience here yesterday!! Both tour guides were outstanding. I believe their names were Ryan (Historical Tour) and Grant (Natural Wonder Tour). They were very well-informed and were able to answer any questions we had. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the surrounding area gorgeous. Will definitely be back!

The staff were all wonderful! Everyone was friendly and the tour guides were very knowledgeable and informative.
The caverns were beautiful.
We also purchased a bag of "mining rough" and my hubby and I were like kids again panning through it to find the treasure.
The facility was clean and parking was great.
I can't think of a single negative thing to say!
