Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to this website and to other websites, applications, services and mobile applications on or in which this Privacy Policy is linked or referenced (the “Sites”), as well as our interactions with you online and offline, including when you shop with us or visit our property (collectively with the Sites, our “Services”). Our Services are owned and/or operated by Pebble Beach Company (sometimes referred to as “we” or “us”). We hope that this Privacy Policy helps clarify how we collect and process your information.
This Privacy Policy describes:
The information we collect on or through our Services and how we collect it.
How we use and process the information we collect.
PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING AND USING OUR SERVICES. When you use our Services or otherwise submit information to us, you consent to the collection and processing of information as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you have not done so already, please also review our Terms of Service (“Terms”), which apply to your use of the Sites. The Terms contain provisions that limit our liability to you and require you to resolve any dispute with us through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis and not as part of any class or representative action.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES.
1. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
The Last Updated Effective Date of this Privacy Policy is set forth at the top of this webpage. As we add new features, we may need to modify this Privacy Policy. Whenever possible, we will provide you with advance written notice of our changes. Your continued use of our Services after the Effective Date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. The amended Privacy Policy supersedes all previous versions. We will not, however, make retroactive changes that reduce your privacy rights unless you affirmatively agree to those changes.
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
“Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could be reasonably linked with a particular individual or household.
Depending on how you use our Services, we may collect the following categories of your Personal Information:
Direct identifiers and contact data, such as your email address, telephone number, social media profile (if you link your account to our Services) and b. national ID or passport information;
Demographic data, such as your gender, your date of birth and your zip code;
Customer record information, such as details of your stay, arrival and departure day and time, vehicle information, and information regarding others traveling with you;
Professional and employment-related data, such as your employer;
Geolocation and other location data, including the precise location of your device and your location as that may be captured through our closed circuit television and other security measures used at our resort;
Internet and network activity data, such as your browsing activity, search history, IP address, and dates/times you access our Services (as further discussed in Section 3.b. below); and
Profile information, such as your room preferences.
We also collect non-identifiable data (such as browser type and device type) and aggregate data sets that show us group-level data and trends about our users and guests (“Non-Identifiable and Aggregate Information”). Non-Identifiable and Aggregate Information does not contain any individual-level data and cannot be used to identify you.
3. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
We collect information that you provide to us and through our Services. The information that we collect and how we process it depends on how and why we collected it. Some information is collected through use of cookies and similar data collection tools (as further discussed in Section 5 below).
Information that You Provide to Pebble Beach Company: You may provide us with your direct identifiers and contact data and demographic information when you contact us for help or information, create an account to use one of our Services or otherwise voluntarily supply your Personal Information to us. We may collect information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
Information that We Collect When You Use the Sites: When you use the Sites, we may automatically collect internet and network activity information about how you interact with the Sites, such as your (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of device(s) used to access the Sites; (iv) web browser(s) used to access the Sites; (v) statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Sites; and (vi) referring web page or other source through which you accessed the Sites.
Information Collected from Other Sources: Third parties that assist us with our business operations also collect your direct identifiers and contact information and internet activity information from you and share it with us. For example, we may purchase mailing lists and use email service providers that help us to more effectively administer our communications and marketing programs.
Information Collected from our Mobile App: The Pebble Beach Resorts mobile app collects geolocation information. If your device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location. If you have consented using your device’s user interface, the geographic location of your device will be transmitted to our servers in real time any time that the App is running (even if you are not actively using the App or it is minimized on your device). Once you set your device to transmit its location information to us, your device will continue to transmit its location information to us (when it is open) until you set your device to no longer do so. You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your device’s location information by accessing the App’s location settings on your device and setting your device not to share its location with us.
4. HOW WE USE, SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION
a. How We Use Information

b. How We Share and Disclose Information
We may share and disclose each category of Personal Information:
With third party service providers that we retain to perform functions on our behalf, such as web hosting, data analyses, and promotion services providers, communication services providers, reservations, and property management providers, and technology and data service providers, that have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions;
To enforce our agreements with other users or third parties, including in connection with claims of copyright infringement;
To protect the safety and security of users and guests;

We and our business partners also may share and disclose Non-Identifiable and Aggregate Information for any purpose permitted by law.
5. ONLINE ADVERTISING, DATA COLLECTION AND “DO NOT TRACK”
a. Cookies & Other Data Collection Tools. “Data Collection Tools” means technology, such as cookies and web beacons, that collects information about your use of our Sites and potentially about your activities when you leave our Sites and visit other websites on the Internet.
b. Online Advertising. Our Sites use Data Collection Tools to help manage our online advertising program. These Data Collection Technologies are provided by us as well as our ad management partners and other third parties.
In addition, we and our ad management partners may use these Data Collection Tools to track the actions of users of our Sites, to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, to deliver advertisements on our Sites that may be more relevant to individual consumers and that will improve the consumer experience on our Sites, and to deliver advertisements to users of our Sites when they visit other third party sites.
We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“Principles”). This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest based advertising purposes. More information about these Principles can be found at www.aboutads.info.
c. Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertisements. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements, please follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices, or www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. An “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements. If you delete Cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again.
Please note that when you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our Sites. It means that the online ads that you do see will not be based on your particular interests.
In addition, please note that certain third parties that we do not control may use Data Collection Tools on Sites. When you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements through one of the links above, these Data Collection Tools may still collect information about your use of our Sites, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the Principles.
6. INFORMATION PROTECTION
Pebble Beach Company has implemented safeguards intended to protect your information from unauthorized access and use. We also strive to ensure that our agents, contractors, and business partners that have access to information in connection with providing services for Pebble Beach Company protect your information. But, while we do work hard to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO PEBBLE BEACH COMPANY IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your information when you use the Internet or store information on your computer, tablet, or mobile device.
7. LINKS TO OTHER SERVICES
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by or through our Services. As noted in the Terms, our Services may contain links to third-party websites and services, including social media (collectively, “Linked Services”). Linked Services are not under the control of Pebble Beach Company and Pebble Beach Company is not responsible for Linked Services. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement by Pebble Beach Company of the Linked Services or any association with the operators of the Linked Services. Pebble Beach Company does not investigate, verify, or monitor the Linked Services. We provide links to Linked Sites for your convenience only. You access Linked Services at your own risk. We encourage you to read about the privacy practices of any Linked Service that you access.
