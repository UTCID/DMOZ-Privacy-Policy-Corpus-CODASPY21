Privacy Impact Assessments
A Privacy Impact Assessment is an opportunity for SANDAG to communicate to the public that it takes the duty to safeguard its data seriously. SANDAG has completed an Agency-wide Privacy Impact Assessment to explain steps the agency is taking with regard to protecting sensitive data and information.
Privacy Impact Assessments also may be completed for specific projects that may more closely focus on the collection and analysis of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and/or other types of confidential information. These Privacy Impact Assessments provide the public with a view of how SANDAG incorporates privacy and security protections into its processes when handling sensitive information with the goal of preserving personal privacy interests.
