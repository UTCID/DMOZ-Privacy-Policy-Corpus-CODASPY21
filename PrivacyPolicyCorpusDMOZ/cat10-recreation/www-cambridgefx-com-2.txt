Security Guidelines for Online Activity
Security guidelines
Security guidelines for a safe and secure online experience
TLS 1.2 protocol
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the protocol used on the internet to encrypt end-to-end connections. If you are using an outdated web browser or your browser is not configured to use TLS 1.2, upgrading your browser to the latest version or changing the settings of your web browser to only allow TLS 1.2 is recommended.
Protect your credentials
To protect user accounts, ensure that a unique user id and password is assigned to each user and ensure that complex and long password is utilized. Also passwords are confidential and should never be shared with anyone. In case you feel that your password has been compromised, change your passwords promptly. Do not share same password on multiple systems, as compromise of credential from one of the systems can be leveraged to access other systems.
Multifactor Authentication
Utilize multi-factory and 2-step verification to protect user accounts from unauthorized access to ensure protection even if your password was stolen.
Cambridge has designed its application to utilize a 2-step verification to protect user accounts from unauthorized access if someone manages to obtain your password. An additional layer of security requires a One Time Password (OTP) to be entered along with your username and password.
OTP and the 2-step verification can be delivered by DUO app on your smartphone, SMS message with a PIN number and Phone call to a land line. The administrator can choose any of the 3 options during initial setup.
Visit only trusted websites
Always verify and ensure correctness of the web page’s URL before entering any personal data such as your user id and password. Ensure the website has HTTPS certificate by clicking on the lock symbol at the top or bottom of the browser window.
Use a recent browser
Using a recent browser is the best way to avoid common attacks and keep your account safe. Cambridge strongly recommends that you update your browsers regularly to ensure you have access to the latest security standards provided by the vendor. You should also update all the plugins (e.g. Java, Flash) that are integrated within the browser.
Phishing & social engineering
What is phishing?Phishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details etc. often for malicious reasons, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity in a mail. It is the most common way to do social engineering. In practice it often involves asking you to click on a link to a malicious website that looks like the site of a trusted institution. Phishing can also be performed via phone or chat by people pretending to be a trusted party, such as the helpdesk.
Secure mailing practices
Use work-related emails only for official purposes
Never send confidential information by email unless it is encrypted
Always check that you are sending an email to the correct person
Read and comply with the Email Policy within your organisation
Protect your email password as emails are often used to verify password resets in some applications
How to Detect a phishing attempt?
It’s usually Unexpected/unsolicited
Contains spelling mistakes
It may lack personal information
It usually requires the recipient to undertake an action such as open attachment, click on a link to access a website, provide information or process a transaction.
How to prevent a phishing attempt?
Always verify the sender’s email address
Do not open any attachment or click on a link whose sender you are unsure of
Do not disclose confidential information to anyone via any webpage or a form
Confirm links embedded in emails by placing your mouse-over the link to see the real URL
Mobile computing
Some helpful security tips while using a mobile device is as follows;
Never leave unattended in a public place or vehicle
Keep locked away when not in use
No confidential information should be stored on corporate mobile devices
Use screen lock and if possible whole disk encryption
Do not install unauthorized software
Do not allow others to use your corporate device
