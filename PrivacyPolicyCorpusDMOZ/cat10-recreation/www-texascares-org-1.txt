We will invite you to volunteer, foster or donate. Texas CARES receives no local, state or federal tax support, nor any United Way funding. We are able to provide our programs and services thanks to the generosity of individuals, corporations and foundations. Because we rely on donations, we will offer you the opportunity to contribute to our mission of caring for our cats whenever you voluntarily submit your name, postal and/or e-mail address or phone numbers. Examples of voluntarily submitting information include (but are not limited to) making a donation and applying to adopt, volunteer or foster.
How we will use your information:
We will use your name, address, email address and/or phone number in order to:
Send information to you, such as newsletters regarding the activities of Texas CARES
Request donations of you and to acknowledge donations made by you in honor of others
Keep a record of your donations made to the organization in accordance with established accounting procedures. Personal information is stored in a secure database which is accessible only to authorized personnel of Texas CARES.
