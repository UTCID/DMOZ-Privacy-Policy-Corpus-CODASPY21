Privacy
The Mazamas have the following privacy policies regarding use of member information:
1. Names, addresses, home phones and emails are published in a printed Membership Directory each year in January. This information is intended solely for personal communication between members. It is not intended, and cannot be used for, any bulk mail, bulk email, and/or otherwise commercial use without the approval of the Mazamas Executive Council.
2. You have complete control over the data that you would like to be public and private on your profile. If you sign up for an activity, your activity leader will have access to your profile information in order to ensure your safety on the activity. Leaders are held to strict policy guidelines.
3. We never sell our membership or contact list. We may partner with another nonprofit to disseminate information that we think is relevant to you. In this case, we will send out contact from our partner but we will not share your information directly with the partner.
4. If you do not want your personal information to be included in the printed or online directory, please email us at adventure@mazamas.org.
