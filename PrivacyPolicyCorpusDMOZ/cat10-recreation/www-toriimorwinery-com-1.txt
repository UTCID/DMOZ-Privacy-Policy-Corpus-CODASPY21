Legal RequirementsYou must be 21 years of age or older, to order or receive alcoholic beverages from Torii Mor Winery. Receipt of shipments containing alcoholic beverages requires the signature of a sober adult (a person 21 years of age or older who is not intoxicated). Wines purchased from Torii Mor Winery are not for resale, and are for personal consumption only.
Credit Card ChargesOrders are by credit card only. We accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.
Minimum PurchaseNo minimum purchase is required.
States Authorized for Direct Shipment Due to the ever-changing nature of wine shipping laws, we may be able to ship wines, directly or indirectly, to all states except . If Torii Mor Winery is unable to ship directly to your state, we can arrange for the sale and shipment of our products through a third party. Please note, when dealing through a third party, wine prices, discounts, and shipping costs may differ from those quoted by Torii Mor Winery.
Shipping CostsUPS is Torii Mor Winery’s carrier of choice. Ground shipping is provided by Federal Express Ground at current market rates. *Note – If the customer selects Fed Ex Air as his or her carrier, the customer pays all shipping charges, regardless of his or her wine club membership or purchase amount.
Wine is a Delicate CommodityWine is a perishable commodity. Wine does not like extremes of temperature: hot humid summer and cold winter weather may adversely affect the condition of your wine during shipment. Torii Mor Winery is not responsible for, and will not replace wine that is damaged by extreme weather conditions during shipment. When your wine order is picked up by the common carrier for delivery, responsibility for the wine becomes the responsibility of the purchaser.
Returns & Cancellations
We will replace or refund you for any bottle of wine that is damaged, flawed or that the customer finds unsatisfactory. We ask the customer return the unfinished portion of the original bottle for replacement. By law, we cannot accept returns of alcoholic beverages unless the product is corked, or flawed. We are also unable to accept return of wine that was damaged due to adverse weather conditions during shipment, or wine that is ordered in error. Please send an email to info@toriimorwinery.com to arrange for the return of corked or flawed product.
Once the wine is received we will refund your credit card account for the cost of the wine less shipping and handling. If the original shipment was damaged or flawed you will receive a full refund, including shipping and handling charges. Please contact the winery at 503-554-0105 x103 for return instructions.
