Other information
If you use our website, we may gather information about the browser you’re using and your IP address. There is a slight possibility we will look to see which site you previously visited or the one you search when you leave us. This is unlikely, however, since we count on repeat and referral business and are not an Internet-based Charter Company.

We may gather information about you from third parties. For example, our business partners may give us information about you that we add to what you provide us.
3. We use information as disclosed and described here.
