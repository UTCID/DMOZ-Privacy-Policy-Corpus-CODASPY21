HPYC Policy Regarding Coronavirus (COVID-19)HPYC Policy Regarding Coronavirus (COVID-19) Customer and Staff SafetyAs has always been the case, the safety and security of our guests and staff remain our highest priority. We take great pride in maintaining the highest standards of cleanliness and hygiene. In response to the coronavirus threat we have taken additional measures to make our cleaning and disinfection protocols even more rigorous: We have implemented the government’s recommendations for a safe working environment including additional cleaning, barriers, social distancing, the provision of PPE and staggered working hours. We would like to share with you our three-step process: Our staff follow government guidelines to minimise the risk of spread of the virus and have all been issued with hand sanitiser, for use when they are not in a position to use soap and water, as well as disposable gloves, face masks, visors and overalls. Anti-bacterial spray surface cleanser is available (subject to availability) on board each yacht for your use during your charter.In fine weather we will conduct the final paperwork procedures outside and in inclement conditions we will request that the number of customers entering our office is limited to one person at any given time.Video handovers and boat notes will be sent to you in advance of your charter and the final handover on the day will as far as possible be carried out on the pontoon. Our staff will be available to assist and support you in any way possible but will always follow our prescribed safety precautions.We will carry out external checks as soon as possible upon return of a yacht but will, where possible (i.e., where a yacht has not been immediately re-chartered) leave 72 hours between the return of a yacht, refuelling and carrying out internal return checks, to minimise risk to our staff. This may result in a slight delay in being able to confirm to you that the yacht has been returned in satisfactory condition and let know any fuel costs.Hired wet weather clothing will be “quarantined” for 72 hours before being made available for reuse.Pillows and tea towels are not currently being provided as part of your charter but are available for purchase as are sleeping bags and towels if required. We have placed a poster on board each of our yachts to remind you and your crew of the guidelines regarding protecting yourself against Coronavirus. Charter and Sailing School Course FlexibilityGiven the current unique circumstances we are making additional adjustments to our booking policies to give you extra peace of mind. For bookings made until further notice:If you or your crew are affected by Coronavirus or by quarantine or border closures then you may rebook your charter or course to another date providing that the revised departure date is within 12 months of the original departure date. If the rescheduled booking is more expensive then the price difference will be due; otherwise the price will remain unchanged.For booking departure date changes made more than two weeks in advance of your original departure date, there will be no charge to rebook your charter to another date. For modifications within two weeks of departure, a £100 admin fee will be charged.Where a charter has been deferred we will request the balance to be payable in two equal stages, the first being half way between the original charter start date and the rescheduled charter start date, and the second being two weeks prior to the rescheduled charter start date.Should you choose to cancel your charter rather than defer it to a later date – although our booking terms state that the balance of your charter is due should you cancel your charter within two months of departure (or for any cancellation in the case of Seafin), we will not be enforcing this clause and would simply retain your charter deposit.

WHAT CLIENTS SAY
Watching the sun go down with a glass of bubbly on the deck of a sparkling yacht was unbelievable. What a treat, and a much needed change of scenery in these troubled times. We will be back for sure
What a treat (RSS)
Fab service, nothing too much trouble, including my daft questions. I'll be a repeat customer for sure!
Fab service, nothing too much trouble (ColinM)
We had a great time sailing with Lee for a few days at the beginning of September. Hamble Point Yacht Charters supplied us an impeccable 45 ft Hanse yacht, which was handled with complete mastery by Captain Lee.It was a privilege to sail with Lee, who is clearly a highly skilled professional taking great pride in his work ... but who is also a fantastic character with a great sense of humour and plenty of fun stories to keep the whole family entertained. He balances the serious side of safety and learning about sailing with a whopping dose of amusement and good cheer. We sailed the Solent in some decent seas, visited Bucklers Hard on the banks of the Beaulieu River and learned lots about British nautical history. Our boys started somewhat of a fishing trend catching bass off the back of the boat in Portsmouth and we would love to sail with Lee again in the future.The man truly knows his stuff, maintained the boat impeccably and went to every effort to ensure that we had a great time. Many thanks to “Shippers” and Hamble Point Charters. We’ll be back.
Best time sailing w/e with Lee ... many thanks to Hamble Point Yacht Charters ()
Chartered bareboats with HPYC on numerous occasions most recently in Sept 2020. Always helpful and accommodating. Highly recommend.
Always helpful and accommodating (SP)
We had a fantastic weekend sailing on Loxley B. Boat in super condition and spotlessly clean, Alex. and the team very thorough and always on hand to answer any questions. A great experience. We will be back. Thank you!
Our first but not last charter!! (CT)
Lots of information from office with a friendly service. We selected a one of the cheaper yachts and was please with find everything work and was cleaned and tidy. We will definitely be back
Very organised and friendly service (AP)
This was the first time we had tried chartering and as experienced racing sailors we didn't know what to expect. Covid has closed down all our events this year so this was a chance to get afloat at least once in 2020. What a great experience and Alex and all the Hamble staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. We had a great three days and we will be back !! We would have no hesitation is recommending Hamble Point Yacht Charters.
First ever charter - we will be back !! (LB)
From initial enquiry to handing the boat back, the service and attention to detail was fantastic. Very prompt service for the minor niggle we did have and with a wide selection of boats to charter, I'll certainly be back. One of the USPs of this business is they are right by the entrance to the Hamble so it's very quick to get out into the Solent compared to other marinas further up where it can take 30-40 mins or more just to reach Southampton water. Big thanks to Alex and the team, we had a great week on a very well kept boat
Excellent, professional outfit. Personal attention from start to finish (SP)
Professional, efficient and friendly. The booking and admin process was straightforward, the handover was well organised and Covid compliant. Most importantly the boat, a Sun Odyssey 37 was in great condition and very well equipped. We will definitely use this company again.
Great Yacht and Professional Service (AE) A short email to say thank you to you and all your team for a fantastic yacht charter and for all your help with our booking at such short notice.     Apaloosa is a lovely yacht and very well equipped.   Hamble Point Marina is a great base to explore from – and my first time sailing from there, although my husband has been a few times.I would also like to praise our skipper, Dave.    He was excellent company, very patient, great at explaining manoeuvres and very happy to involve the children so that they could learn too.    Given the weather conditions and our rusty knowledge, it was very reassuring to have him with us.   Dave was very happy to impart his knowledge and he ensured we made the most of our short charter.     We would definitely request him again!So, thank you once again, it was great fun, and have a good weekend.
Fantastic yacht charter (RP)
One of the larger charter companies which means they have a large fleet and permanent office staff, a big plus. I chartered Loxley B (37ft Sun Odyssey). Boat was clean, well equipped, well maintained. Office staff was really friendly and efficient in answering questions quickly. Will use this company again.
Friendly and professional (GV)
Thanks to all again for a great charter and the effort taken to make the handover so efficient. Especially with the videos
Great charter ()
First time using Hamble Point Yacht Charter and will definitely be back. Location, range of boats and value for money all excellent. The team was very friendly and efficient, and the boat we chartered (Blue) was in good condition and well equipped.
A weekend on Blue (JY)
Chartered 37 Hallberg Rassy for a weekend mid Jan. Booking process and communication prior to booking was friendly and informative. The yacht was immaculate and had everything we needed for the weekend. Simple check out process, lots of information provided in the personal review of the yacht. Returning the yacht was just as simple and the security deposit was refunded within 3 days. Highly recommended, we will be returning customers.
Winter weekend bareboat charter (RH)
We comprised a group of 5 friends; Chartering Kasara, a well appointed Halberg Rassy 36, for a long weekend, taking part in the Round Table Area 45 Presidents Rally.The boat was clean and ready for our arrival, and we were away in good time, she sailed well and when we returned on the Sunday evening the hand back was quick and easy.We all agreed we had had a great time, and would charter again in the future
