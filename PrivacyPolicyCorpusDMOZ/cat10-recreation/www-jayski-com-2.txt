12. Disputes/Arbitration. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY -- IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
The JAYSKI.com Parties and you agree that these Terms of Use affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or in connection with your access to, and/or use of JAYSKI.com, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through JAYSKI.com, the JAYSKI.com Parties or you must give the other notice of the dispute, claim, or controversy which notice will include a brief written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, claim, or controversy and the relief requested. You must send any such notice to JAYSKI.com by email to jayski@jayski.com. To the extent that JAYSKI.com has your contact information, it will send any such notice to you by U.S. Mail, or otherwise to your email address. The JAYSKI.com Parties and you will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of dispute, claim, or controversy is sent. The JAYSKI.com Parties and you shall use reasonable, good faith, efforts to settle any dispute, claim, or controversy through consultation and good faith negotiations. After 30 days, the JAYSKI.com Parties or you may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice and 30-day negotiation period required by this paragraph shall not apply, however, to disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of JAYSKI.com.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind between the JAYSKI.com Parties and you arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with your access to, and/or use of JAYSKI.com, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through JAYSKI.com, if unresolved through informal discussions within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in North Carolina. Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of JAYSKI.com shall not be subject to arbitration.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and the JAYSKI.com Parties and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in or for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and fee information are available at "www.adr.org," or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  Each party shall be responsible for the costs that it may incur in the arbitration including, but not limited to attorneys’ fees and expert witness costs unless the other party is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on the JAYSKI.com Parties and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The JAYSKI.com Parties and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorneys’ fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the JAYSKI.com Parties and you agree not to seek any attorneys’ fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose. The JAYSKI.com Parties and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, the JAYSKI.com Parties and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. The JAYSKI.com Parties and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by these arbitration provisions by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following Email address jayski@jayski.com with the subject line “JAYSKI.com Opt Out”. The notice must be sent within the later of 30 days of your first use of JAYSKI.com or within 30 days of changes to this section being announced on JAYSKI.com, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate any disputes, claims, or controversies in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the JAYSKI.com Parties also will not be bound by them. If you do not affirmatively elect to opt out as described above, your use of JAYSKI.com will be deemed to be your irrevocable acceptance of these Terms of Use and any changes/updates to this section or otherwise.
If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect. In the event some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, the JAYSKI.com Parties and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.
The terms of these arbitration provisions will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any JAYSKI.com Party, present or future parent or affiliated company of the JAYSKI.com Parties, or any person or entity involved in creating, producing or distributing JAYSKI.com, including, without limitation, third-party content providers, vendors, advertisers and licensors, to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of JAYSKI.com, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through JAYSKI.com.
13. Class Action Waiver. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY -- IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
The JAYSKI.com Parties and you agree that the JAYSKI.com Parties and you will resolve any disputes, claims or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims brought under these Terms of Use in connection with JAYSKI.com will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. The JAYSKI.com Parties and you further agree that the JAYSKI.com Parties and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with JAYSKI.com.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in or near Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.
The terms of this provision will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any JAYSKI.com Party, present or future parent or affiliated company of any JAYSKI.com Party, or any person or entity involved in creating, producing or distributing JAYSKI.com, including, without limitation, third-party content providers, vendors, advertisers and licensors, to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of JAYSKI.com, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through JAYSKI.com.
14. Miscellaneous. These Terms of Use, including the Privacy Statement, and any operating rules for JAYSKI.com established by the JAYSKI.com Parties, constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. The provisions of these Terms of Use are for the benefit of the JAYSKI.com Parties, present or future parent or affiliated companies of the JAYSKI.com Parties, and any person or entity involved in creating, producing or distributing JAYSKI.com, including, without limitation, third-party content providers, vendors, advertisers and licensors and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf. If you access JAYSKI.com from any location other than the United States, you accept full responsibility for compliance with all local laws. You are also subject to United States export controls and are responsible for any violations of United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting exports. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. If any part of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, it will be replaced with language reflecting the original purpose in a valid and enforceable manner. The enforceable sections of these Terms of Use will remain binding upon the parties. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.
Neither the JAYSKI.com Parties nor you shall be liable for damages or for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts or occurrences beyond their reasonable control, including, without limitation: fire, lightning, explosion, power surge or failure, water, acts of God, war, terrorism, revolution, civil commotion or acts of civil or military authorities or public enemies: any law, order, regulation, ordinance, or requirement of any government or legal body or any representative of any such government or legal body; or labor unrest, including without limitation, strikes, slowdowns, picketing, or boycotts; inability to secure raw materials, transportation facilities, fuel or energy shortages, or acts or omissions of other common carriers.
