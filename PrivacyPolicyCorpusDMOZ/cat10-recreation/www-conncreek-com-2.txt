You agree to abide by such Application terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these terms and the terms of the Application, the terms of the Application will control as relating to the Application.
Order ConfirmationYour receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute an offer to sell. We reserve the right, at any time after receipt of your order, to accept or decline your order for any reason.
State Law LimitationsIn some instances state law regulates product availability and/or sets product purchase limitations, which may limit our ability to fulfill order requests. We may, at our discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household, or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by the same account and/or the same credit card, or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event we change or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting you via the telephone, e-mail, and/or billing address provided at the time the order was made. If applicable, please see our Shipping & Service Policy for more details.
Product SubstitutionsThough we continually monitor our inventory to ensure product availability, there are times when products may be out of stock. We will call or e-mail you to determine if you would like to wait for the product to be in stock, substitute other items, or cancel part or all of the order. In cases where a substitution is necessary, we will contact you before shipping and provide the option to substitute your item(s). If you decide to make a substitution, the final item(s) you choose (with the corresponding price increase(s) and/or decrease(s)) will end up on the invoice and not the initial item(s) chosen. If you decide not to make a substitution, we will ship the available item(s) minus the out of stock item(s) or, if you would prefer, cancel the order. We will not ship partial orders without first getting your consent, we will not charge your credit card until we ship your order, and you will not be charged for out-of-stock items.
Legal Age RequirementAlcohol may only be sold and delivered to a person who is of legal drinking age. By placing an order on the website, you represent to us that you are of legal drinking age and the person to whom any wine (or other alcoholic beverage) will be delivered is also of legal drinking age, and you agree and consent to our comprehensive age verification process. All states allowing alcohol shipments to consumers require a signature, at the time of delivery, from a person of legal drinking age. Proof of age must be produced. We comply with all federal, state, and local laws regarding sale of alcohol to minors. If applicable, please see our Shipping & Service Policy for more details.
ShippingIf applicable, all orders placed on this website are subject to product availability and will be shipped according to our Shipping & Service Policy. We are prohibited from shipping to certain states, we cannot ship outside the United States, and we cannot ship to P.O. boxes. We ship orders via third party carriers, such as United Parcel Service, and Federal Express.
Each state that allows us to ship directly to consumers requires the signature, at the time of delivery, of a person of legal drinking age. Failure to produce age verification upon request forfeits the right to receive the shipment until identification is produced. In such circumstances, the order will be shipped back to us at your expense.
You are responsible for all shipping charges unless we expressly agree otherwise. Shipping charges will be calculated during the on-line ordering process. Shipping and handling charges are nonrefundable unless we sent the wrong item.
Errors On Our WebsitePrices and availability of products and services are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected where discovered, and we reserve the right to modify any stated solicitation(s) for offers and to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions including after an order has been submitted and whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge. Individual bank policies will dictate when this amount is credited to your account.
