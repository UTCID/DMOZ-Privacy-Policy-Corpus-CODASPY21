Any claim between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms, our Privacy Notice, and/or the Site or Services shall be resolved exclusively within the federal and state courts residing within or serving Frederick County, State of Maryland, and you waive any jurisdictional venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or enjoin misappropriation, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or infringement of our intellectual property rights.

Class actions, private attorney general actions, consolidation of your dispute with any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity are not permitted and are waived by you, and a court will have no jurisdiction to hear such claims.
If a court finds that the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then the class action waiver will not apply to those parts.
Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law.
If any other provision of this dispute resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect.
