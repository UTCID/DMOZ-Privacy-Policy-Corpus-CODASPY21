TERMS OF USE
Effective Date: August 14, 2019
1. INTRODUCTION
This Terms of Use Agreement (this “Agreement”) applies to any and all websites, apps, and online services associated with Boardriders, Inc. and its affiliates, subsidiaries and brands, including Quiksilver, Billabong, Roxy, DC Shoes, RVCA, Element, VonZipper, Xcel, Honolua, Dot Dash and the Boardriders Foundation (“Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) and all affiliated domains that link to this Agreement, through any related mobile application, through computerized devices in stores and in-store data collection forms, and through any location where this Agreement is posted (collectively referred to herein as the “Sites”). By using the Sites, you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and any and all rules, guidelines and directions found throughout the Sites. Please read this Agreement carefully. This Agreement applies to all users of the Sites, including users who are viewers of material on the Sites and users who register for the Sites as set forth below in Section 9.
Please note the arbitration provision set forth below, requiring—except where and to the extent prohibited by law, which may include the province of Quebec—you to arbitrate any claims you may have against Company on an individual basis. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, IF ANY, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY
2. AGE LIMITATION
By using the Sites you represent that you are at least 13 years old. YOU MAY NOT USE OR REGISTER FOR THE SITES IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13.
3. PRIVACY
Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your visit to the Sites, to understand our privacy practices
4. CONSIDERATION
You acknowledge that this Agreement is supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged. Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge that such consideration includes, without limitation, your use of the Sites and receipt of data, materials and information available at or through the Sites.
5. DISPUTES AND AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
Except where and to the extent prohibited by law, which may include the province of Quebec, by using the Sites, you and Company agree that, if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Sites, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement or any part of it (“Dispute”), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent:
to Company at: Boardriders, Inc., Attention: Legal Department, 5600 Argosy Circle, Building #100, Huntington Beach, CA 92649
to you at: your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address that we may have on file for you.
Both you and Company agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party. IF ANY DISPUTE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE ABOVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, YOU AGREE THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. Other rights that you and we would have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights. All such Disputes shall be exclusively submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for binding arbitration under its rules then in effect, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Use, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use are void or voidable.
6. CHOICE OF LAW
This Agreement has been made in, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16).
7. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

You agree to the foregoing grant of rights, consents, and agreements whether or not your Comments are used by us.
You hereby appoint us as your agent with full power to enter into and execute any document and/or do any act we may consider appropriate to confirm the grant of rights, consents, agreements, and waivers set forth in this Agreement.

12. LICENSE AND SITE ACCESS
Company grants you a limited, revocable and nonexclusive license to access and make personal use of the Sites but not to download (other than page caching) or modify it, or any portion of it, except with express written consent of Company. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of the Sites or their contents; any collection and use of any product listings, descriptions, or prices; any derivative use of the Sites or their contents; any downloading or copying of account information for the benefit of another merchant; or any use of data mining, robots, spiders or similar data gathering and extraction tools.  Neither the Sites nor any portion of the Sites may be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without express written consent of Company. You may not frame or use framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of Company and its affiliates, licensors or licensees without express written consent of Company. You may not use meta tags or any other hidden text using Company's brand names or trademarks without the express written consent of Company. Any unauthorized use will immediately terminate the permission or license granted by Company.  You are granted a limited, revocable, and nonexclusive right to create a hyperlink to the home page of the Sites so long as the link does not portray Company or its products or services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive manner as determined by Company in its sole discretion. You may not use any Company logo or other proprietary graphic or trademark as part of the link without express written permission of Company. You may not make any other part of the Sites, other than the home page of the Sites, available as part of another service by "deep linking," or otherwise, without prior written permission from Company. Any permitted links to the Sites must comply will all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
13. THIRD-PARTY AND CO-BRANDED SITES
The Sites may contain hyperlinks (“links”) to websites operated by persons or entities other than Company (“third-party Websites”) or to co-branded websites operated by a third party, including Company's affiliates and licensees (“co-branded Websites”). We provide such links for your reference and convenience only. A link from the Sites to a third-party or co-branded Website does not mean or imply that Company endorses the content on that third-party or co-branded Website or the operator or operations of that third-party or co-branded Website. Company explicitly disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or availability of information, content and materials found on any third-party or co-branded Website. Company does not endorse any of the merchandise, nor can we ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from a third-party or co-branded Website. Company does not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information, content or materials (including, without limitation, credit card and other personal information) you might be requested to give to any third-party. You hereby irrevocably waive any claim against Company with respect to information, content and materials contained on any third-party or co-branded Website, and any information, content and materials you provide to such third-party or co-branded Website (including, without limitation, credit card and other personal information). You are solely responsible for determining the extent to which you use any content at any third-party or co-branded Website to which you might link from our Sites. Your use of any website linked to from the Sites is subject to the policies and procedures of the owner of such website, and your use of all such websites is subject to such policies and procedures and not to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You understand that by using any third-party Website linked to from the Sites, you may be exposed to content or other materials that are offensive, indecent, defamatory or otherwise objectionable. We therefore strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third-parties.
COMPANY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANY DEALINGS WITH ANY THIRD-PARTY OR CO-BRANDED WEBSITE, ANY MERCHANT OR OPERATOR OF A THIRD-PARTY OR CO-BRANDED WEBSITE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON WITH WHOM YOU ENGAGE IN ANY TRANSACTION.
14. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
You agree to comply with all applicable laws in connection with your use of the Sites, and such further limitations as may be set forth in any written or on-screen notice from Company. As a condition of your use of the Sites, you warrant that you will not use the Sites for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement. All information that you provide in connection with any interaction with the Sites or any co-branded Website must be accurate, complete, and current.

causing us to lose (in whole or part) the services of our internet service providers or other suppliers;
linking to materials or other content, directly or indirectly, to which you do not have a right to link;
using the site in a manner that is false, misleading, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable, as determined by Company in its sole discretion;
harvesting or otherwise automatically collecting any information (including without limitation personal information) about other users of the Sites, including, without limitation, e-mail addresses, without the express consent of such users;

violating, or encouraging anyone to violate, any applicable local, state, national, or international law, regulation or order.
15. TERMINATION OR RESTRICTION
Company may terminate or restrict your access to all or any part of the Sites at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. You may also terminate your use of the Sites at any time, provided that all of the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty and disclaimers shall survive any such termination.
16. RISK OF LOSS
All products purchased from the Sites are transported and delivered to you by an independent carrier not affiliated with, or controlled by, Company. Title to products purchased on the Sites, as well as the risk of loss for such products, passes to you when Company delivers these items to the carrier.
17. PRODUCT INFORMATION
Company attempts to be accurate in describing its products and services on the Sites. We do not warrant that product and service descriptions or other content of this or any other Sites are complete, reliable, current, or error-free.
We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear on the Sites. However, as the actual colors you see depend on your computer monitor and other factors beyond Company's control, we cannot guarantee that your computer's display of any color on the Sites will be accurate.
Most Company products displayed on the Sites are available in select retail stores in the United States and Canada while supplies last. In some cases, merchandise displayed for sale at the Sites may not be available in retail stores. Unless otherwise stated, the prices displayed at the Sites are quoted in U.S. or Canadian Dollars.
18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY
THE SITES ARE PROVIDED BY COMPANY ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, COMPANY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SITES OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR LINKED SERVICES PROVIDED ON OR THROUGH THE SITES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SITES WILL BE FREE FROM ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, OR DELAY IN OPERATION, OR FROM TECHNICAL INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS; THAT THE SITES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; THAT DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE CONTENT ON THE SITES IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ANY INFORMATION ON THE SITES IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE, AND WE DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE CHANGES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC, COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY, OR ANY PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SITES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE OR NATURE ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS, USE, MISUSE, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES OR ANY LINKED SITES OR SERVICES; IN THE EVENT A THIRD PARTY INTERCEPTS OR DECRYPTS ANY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO COMPANY THROUGH THE SITES; OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, OR LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, WHETHER IN AN ACTION UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. CERTAIN STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.
19. MISCELLANEOUS LEGAL PROVISIONS
Company may discontinue the Sites at any time and for any reason, without notice. Company may change, suspend, or cancel the contents, operation, or any and all other features of the Sites at any time for any reason, without notice.
Company reserves the right to update and/or change the terms of this Agreement. If we make any material changes to this Agreement (as determined by us), we will post a notice on the Sites notifying users of the changes and providing an opportunity for you to take action relative to those changes prior to their implementation. In some cases, we also may send an email notifying registered users of upcoming changes. This Agreement was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Sites after any changes or revisions to this Agreement become effective shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised and then-current Agreement.
You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Company as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Sites. Nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Sites or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
Company's failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement or respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive its right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of this Agreement or to act with respect to similar breaches. You shall not resell or assign your rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement, and any attempted assignment or delegation will be void and of no force or effect whatsoever. This Agreement may be automatically assigned by Company, in our sole discretion, to a third party, and such an assignment will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and/or licensees.
If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, and the invalid unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision.
This Agreement constitutes the entire and final agreement regarding the Sites and its contents, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous communications between you and Company regarding the Sites and their contents.
All rights not expressly granted herein are hereby reserved to Company.
