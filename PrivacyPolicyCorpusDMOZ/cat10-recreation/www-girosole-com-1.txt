"...the perfect combination..."
We had a marvelous trip, and much of it was due to the planning that went into the Girosole itinerary – it was the perfect combination of walking, scenery, history, culture, time spent with the group, and time to explore on our own. I can’t imagine a better way to see the Amalfi coast. Our guide Ulisse was very friendly and helpful – he did a wonderful job of keeping us organized, giving us the history of the area, and providing advice on things to do when we were on our own. We would like to travel again with Girosole (maybe Tuscany next time) and will certainly recommend the walking tours to all of our friends.
