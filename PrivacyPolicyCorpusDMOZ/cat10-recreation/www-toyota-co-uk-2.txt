Toyota (GB) PLC is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and is an introducer appointed representative of Toyota Insurance Management plc and Toyota Financial Services (UK) PLC, both of which are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, in respect of insurance mediation activities only.
Toyota Financial Services is a trading name of Toyota Financial Services (UK) PLC.

Toyota Insurance Management plc and Toyota Financial Services (UK) PLC are not subsidiaries of each other
Applicable lawThese terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. Unless we otherwise agree in writing any dispute regarding the interpretation of the terms that cannot be resolved informally shall be referred to and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales.
Statement of Toyota (GB) PLC's policy regarding bribery, corruption and anti-competitive practicesToyota (GB) PLC and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "the TGB Group") are committed to conducting business openly, fairly and honestly. The TGB Group therefore maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards bribery, corruption and anti-competitive practices. This policy applies to all TGB Group personnel plus certain contractors on each occasion they have contact with an individual, firm or organisation outside the TGB Group (collectively referred to as "External Persons") for Toyota business purposes. External Persons include without limitation: prospective and existing suppliers; prospective and existing customers; prospective and existing network centres and service outlets; public bodies with whom the TGB Group has a non-commercial relationship; charities; and competitors.
It should be noted that TGB Group personnel are required to report internally amongst other things:
(a) Any financial interest that they have or an associate of theirs has in an External Person. An associate is defined as including a spouse, a partner and any blood or step relative of the person making the declaration or their spouse or partner.
(b) The offer and receipt of all forms of business related gift and hospitality with limited exceptions.
(c) The rejection of the offer of any business related gift and hospitality, whether inward or outward.
(d) Any form of improper behaviour by an External Person or a work colleague.
The offer and receipt of certain types of gift and hospitality are prohibited to TGB Group personnel, for example personal payments that do not form part of legitimate business hospitality and all forms of gifts and hospitality that are offered during the process of bidding or tendering for contracts. Certain other forms of gift and hospitality are discouraged, for example gifts worth more than £25 and gifts and hospitality to family members. Any External Person that acts improperly may find their relationship with the TGB Group curtailed either at an individual or corporate level. Further action may be taken depending on the seriousness of the situation.
Toyota Customer CharterAt Toyota we are committed to providing a high level of customer satisfaction and quality products. Both Toyota (GB) PLC and our Toyota Centre network abide by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute approved Motor Industry Codes of Practice for vehicle sales, service and repair. However, we recognise that we may not always be able to offer dispute resolutions which suit all parties involved.
The first point of contact should be the Toyota Centre you purchased your vehicle from when querying an issue with your vehicle or the service you receive. If this cannot be resolved this can then be escalated to the Centre Manager, or Managing Director of that particular group.
Should this option not provide a suitable resolution, the next option is to contact The Motor Ombudsman. The Motor Ombudsman is a provider of Alternative Dispute Resolution, offering an impartial service to resolve a compliant. They can be contacted at www.themotorombudsman.org or on 0345 241 3008.
Our New Car Sales CommitmentAll vehicles featured in our warranty, pricing and marketing publications will be advertised honestly. The most up to date information regarding your new vehicle purchase can be obtained from your Toyota Centre.
We advise that necessary precautions are taken in order to check that the specification, appearance and dimensions of your potential purchase match your requirements. A test drive of the vehicle is highly recommended and we suggest that any specification queries are taken up with your Toyota Centre before purchase.
Our Used Car Sales Commitment If you are buying a used car you should check the vehicle history, check that the vehicle has all the features you need and thoroughly inspect the vehicle to ensure that you are happy with the condition.
In the event of an issue arising through the purchase of a used car, the contract of sale is through the Toyota Centre and not Toyota (GB) PLC, therefore any issues should be taken up with the Centre Manager or, alternatively if you feel that your dispute is not resolved you can contact The Motor Ombudsman.

WLTP
New test method for fuel economy and emissionsSince the 1980s, European new car emissions and fuel economy tests have been carried out using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). From 1 September 2017, a new test has been introduced, the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), to give both car buyers and owners a more realistic understanding of a car's performance.
New test method for fuel economy and emissionsSince the 1980s, European new car emissions and fuel economy tests have been carried out using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). From 1 September 2017, a new test has been introduced, the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), to give both car buyers and owners a more realistic understanding of a car's performance.
What is WLTP?The European Union has developed a new test called the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) which came into effect on 1st September 2017 for new type approvals and 1 September 2018 for all vehicles. This will replace the current New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure for establishing the official Fuel Consumption and CO2 emissions of new cars.
The new WLTP laboratory test will also be supplemented by an emissions test that measures pollutants directly on the road: RDE (Real Driving Emissions) and was brought in to the new testing regime to provide a closer representation of ‘real-world’ fuel consumption and CO2 figures and provide model specific values at the point of sale.
WLTP Facts
Source: http://wltpfacts.eu
What is RDE?This takes place on real roads, the RDE test compliments lab tests by measuring that a car delivers low pollutant emissions on the road.
Real driving emission (RDE) tests will measure the pollutants, such as NOx, emitted by cars while driven on the road. RDE will not replace laboratory tests, such as the current NEDC and the future WLTP but it will be additional to them. Europe is the first region in the world to introduce such on-the-road testing, marking a major leap in the testing of car emissions.
RDE Information
Introducing greater clarityEveryday tests, realistic resultsThe new WLTP tests will ensure that lab measurements now better reflect the situations you will experience in everyday life. This means that fuel consumption and emissions values displayed for new cars are a far better representation of what you are actually likely to achieve.
At Toyota, we welcome the change to WLTP, which will provide our customers with a more accurate basis for calculating fuel economy and emissions. As a leader in clean mobility, we’ve spent decades researching how to make vehicles that are kinder to the environment, producing technologies such as hybrid that have proved their value in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and helping the move towards a low carbon society.
“Hybrid is the backbone of our powertrain programme and will help us cut our vehicle carbon emissions by 90% by 2050 compared to 2010.”
Dr. Johan van Zyl, President and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe
NEDC to WLTP: what’s changing?With advances in vehicle technology and changes in driving conditions, the near-40-year-old NEDC driving cycle test has been replaced. To give you a more accurate way of calculating and comparing a car’s fuel consumption and emissions, the new WLTP test introduces more realistic testing conditions, so that lab measurements better reflect the on-road performance of a car.
Test Cycle
Dynamic tests which are more representative of real-driving behaviour
Cycle Time
Test lasts 30 minutes, an increase of 10 minutes
Cycle Distance
23.25 kilometres long, over twice the old distance
Driving Phases
More dynamic phases: 52% urban and 48% non-urban
Average & Maximum Speeds
Average speed is 46.5km/h (an increase of 12.5km/h) while top speed is raised to 131km/h
Optional Equipment
Additional vehicle options (impacting CO2 and consumption) are taken into account
Gear Shifts
Each vehicle has different, rather than fixed, gear shift points
Test Temperatures
Measurements now taken at 23ºC (and CO2 values corrected to 14ºC) vs 20-30ºC.
What does WLTP mean for me?WLTP will facilitate a better means of assessing how high the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of the vehicle may be on average. At the same time, however, more realistic values will also mean higher consumption and CO2 values for vehicles with combustion engines and a lower electric range for electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrids). These new tests will not have any effect or change the performance of the vehicle.
As Toyota transition to WLTP the following type approval timings will apply:
Commercial and Passenger vehicles (types M1 and N1 (i)):
• From September 2017, all new model introductions are subject to WLTP type approval and Real Driving Emissions (RDE) testing.
• From September 2018, all new registrations need to comply to WLTP type approval.
• From September 2019, all new registrations need to comply to RDE testing. Light Commercial Vehicles (Category N1
• From September 2018, all new Light Commercial vehicle model introductions will be subject to WLTP type approval and Real Driving Emissions (RDE) testing.
• From September 2019, all new registrations of Light Commercial Vehicles need to comply to type approval under WLTP and all new registrations will be subject to RDE testing.
What impact will this have on taxation?From 1st April 2020 WLTP CO2 figures will be used to calculate your vehicles first year VED tax payment, often referred to as VED – please visit the government vehicle tax rates page for a full listing of vehicle tax rates from 1st April 2020. From 6th April 2020, WLTP CO2 figures will be used for company car tax purposes – please visit the government rates and allowances page for full listing of company car tax rates from 6th April 2020.
Will WLTP test for other air quality pollutants?WLTP is also used to measure substances such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particles (PM/PN).
When will light commercial vehicle values change?WLTP certification is mandatory for all light commercial vehicles from 1 September 2019.

Procurement Policy
A.	PurposeThis document sets out the policy of Toyota (GB) PLC (“TGB”) regarding the purchase of goods and services. It applies to all staff including employees and contractors.
Our policy is to seek the purchase of goods and services from suppliers that enhance positive impacts on the environment and society whilst meeting our business requirements. By incorporating social, environmental and ethical considerations into procurement decisions we endeavour to make a positive contribution to the environment and society.
B.	About this policyIn support of this policy TGB will:
(a) assign responsibility to named responsible individuals and provide adequate management oversight;
(b) allocate funds for the effective direction, implementation and continuous improvement of this policy;
(c) measure and monitor the application of this policy;
(d) review this policy at least once every two years; and
(e) conduct an environmental, social and ethical assessment of relevant suppliers. It is understood that all organisations that we do business with must comply with relevant national and international regulations. In the event of any conflict between those laws and this policy, then the provisions that give the greatest level of protection should be applied.
No individual who works for TGB may commit the company to any form of financial expenditure unless they follow this policy.
C.	Knowing our supply chainTGB has an obligation to be aware of the working conditions and other practices used within our supply chain. It is our policy to carry out an appropriate level of due diligence, relating to the financial status and the other factors outlined below in this document, on all business partners. This must always be completed before any new supplier is engaged.
D.	TGB’s CommitmentThis policy sits within our established procurement practices that ensure a fair and transparent procurement process that operates in line with all applicable laws and regulations. To ensure that this policy works adequately, TGB will:
(a) work collaboratively with suppliers to improve environmental, social and ethical standards;
(b) protect the confidentiality of information entrusted to us;
(c) require suppliers to realise reasonable environmental, social and ethical standards;
(d) ensure that all TGB staff are aware of this policy;
(e) ensure that compliance with this policy is applied equally to all of our suppliers;
(f) seek to exert commercial influence where we are confident that improvements can be made in environmental, social or ethical performance of suppliers;
(g) ensure that all suppliers’ staff working on our premises are afforded the same levels of respect and safety as our own staff;
(h) base our supplier selection on objective and transparent criteria that include the consideration of environmental, social and ethical performance;
(i) cease trading with suppliers showing persistent disregard for important elements of environmental, social and ethical performance or that do not meet our internal criteria for selection;
(j) act as an advocate for responsible supply chain practices within our industry sector; and
(k) use a risk based approach to ensure we focus on those areas where the risk is greatest and maximum impact can be achieved.
E.	Procurement Process (a) The rationale behind supplier selection is to ensure suppliers have the capacity, the capability and have a fair opportunity to contract with TGB. The process includes:
(i) identifying our own business requirements;
(ii) researching the market for the goods and services required;
(iii) developing a procurement strategy, assessing and selecting potential bidders;
(iv) completion of our tender process; and
(v) selecting the supplier/s that offer the best fit with all selection criteria.
(b) Credit checks will be run against potential suppliers to ensure TGB is aware of trading history and their ongoing viability as a business.
(c) When selecting suppliers TGB may request certain information and documentation. We may also require suppliers to register with our preferred due diligence portal to allow effective checking of all suppliers to be completed. Weighted selection criteria include quality, financial viability and sustainability.
(d) TGB standard terms and conditions will be entered into with suppliers, as a minimum requirement. For any transaction above £30,000 a full legal agreement, rather than standard form terms and conditions, should be used between the parties. TGB’s Procurement and Legal & Compliance departments will advise on which agreement is to be used.
F. 	Expectations of our suppliersTGB expects that all of our suppliers adhere to the following principles. All suppliers should:
(a) have management systems in place to enable compliance with all relevant legal requirements and this policy in their own operations and those of their supply chain;
(b) comply, at all times, with all relevant international labour conventions;
(c) communicate their expectations for compliance on the issues covered in this policy to all relevant employees and suppliers;
(d) provide evidence, upon reasonable request from TGB, to enable assessment of their compliance with this policy; and
(e) demonstrate continuous improvement in their approach to sustainable and responsible purchasing.
G. 	Importance of working conditionsTGB does not use or accept any forced, bonded, involuntary or child labour. We will only ever work with people that choose to work freely. We respect the right of everybody to equal opportunities and insist that all business partners meet our own standards. We expect our suppliers and business partners to adopt and demonstrate the following minimum standards:
(a) Child Labour: Organisations should ensure the effective long-term elimination of child labour. No young person under 18 should be employed at night or in hazardous conditions.
(b) Forced Labour: There should be no use of forced, bonded or involuntary labour. No worker should ever be required to lodge a “deposit” or identity papers with their employers. All workers should be able to leave after giving reasonable notice.
(c) Health & Safety: All employees should expect to work in an environment that is both safe and healthy. Adequate steps should be taken to prevent accidents occurring in the normal course of work. All workers should receive suitable health and safety training and have access to clean toilet facilities and clean drinking water as required.
(d) Abuse: Physical abuse (actual or threatened), all forms of harassment, verbal abuse and any other form of intimidation are never acceptable. Disciplinary and grievance procedures must be clearly documented and communicated appropriately.
(e) Freedom of Association: All workers have the right to form and join organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation.
(f) Working Hours: Working hours should not be excessive and shall comply with relevant national laws. Overtime should only be voluntary.
(g) Equal Treatment: Organisations will seek to eliminate all forms of discrimination in access to employment, training and working conditions.
(h) Remuneration: Wages and benefits given to workers should meet national standards. All workers should be provided with written information on their pay and conditions.
(i) Employment terms: All workers should be provided with written contracts which detail the terms and conditions of their employment in an understandable way. Work performed should be on the basis of recognised employment law and practice.
(j) Community impact: Organisations are encouraged to support the communities in which they operate through appropriate community initiatives.
H. 	Ethical TradingTGB is committed to respecting the dignity, liberty and equality of everyone that we work with. This includes maintaining an interest in the business practices used by companies and business partners that supply goods or services to us.
All of our suppliers must be able to demonstrate the existence of proportionate processes and procedures to implement appropriate staff guidelines and codes of conduct. Suppliers should ensure that management systems and practices are in place to ensure the prevention of:
(a) money laundering;
(b) insider trading and market abuse or manipulation;
(c) conflicts of interest;
(d) fraud, bribery and corruption and other improper payments, gifts or hospitality; and
(e) unauthorised access to personal and business information.
I. 	Energy & EnvironmentThe Toyota Group’s commitment to protecting and respecting the environment forms an important part of its Guiding Principles. We seek to ensure that appropriate attention is paid to environmental issues in the purchase of all products and services for our business. All suppliers should be able to demonstrate:
(a) documented policies relating to environmental performance and energy management;
(b) the ability to monitor and review environmental performance and energy efficiency;
(c) the degree to which their operations are covered by recognised environmental management systems and any intentions towards such accreditation;
(d) the awareness of potential environmental risks inherent in their operations;
(e) the implementation of processes to mitigate or minimise potential environmental risks;
(f) the degree to which products and services have been designed with environmental considerations in mind.
As part of their commitment to good environmental performance, all suppliers should seek to:
(a) minimise the use of energy, water and raw materials where practical;
(b) maximise the use of recyclable and renewable materials including energy;
(c) make practical efforts to minimise waste and dispose of it in a safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible manner; and
(d) avoid contamination of the local environment and ensure that emissions, air, noise and odour pollution is, as a minimum, within nationally defined limits.

Modern Slavery Statement
Modern Slavery Statement 2020For the financial year ending 31 March 2020 Modern slavery encompasses various exploitative acts such as slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour for the purpose of personal or commercial gain. Toyota (GB) PLC (“TGB”) and Toyota Financial Services (UK) PLC (“TFS”) together (“we”), (“us”) continue to implement and endorse responsible business practices to ensure compliance with applicable modern slavery law and to uphold the integrity of our brands, ‘Toyota’ and ‘Lexus’. This is our fifth joint statement under s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”) and it sets out the actions we have taken to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking within our businesses and supply chain since our last statement was published in September 2019 (“2019 Statement”).
We also work closely with our UK manufacturing operations, Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) Limited (“TMUK”), to share best practice and experience. This year we are publishing TMUK’s statement alongside our own to ensure customers, suppliers and other stakeholders have transparency in understanding our approach in this area.
This statement applies for the financial year ending 31st March 2020.
Supplier Audits TGB continues to place greater responsibility on its suppliers to be transparent about their business operations. Through its auditing procedures, TGB monitors and assesses supplier’s compliance with the Act and recommends appropriate remedial and best-practice actions if needed. This allows us to strengthen the working relationships TGB has with its supply chain and to promote the welfare and wellbeing of their workers.
Over the last financial year, TGB has continued to conduct audits on higher-risk suppliers. Despite the outbreak of COVID-19, TGB has continued its audit activity, utilising technology to conduct audits where in-person audits have not been possible. The approach to audit continues to evolve, with TGB’s internal audit and procurement teams continually shaping the methodology matrix and audit checklist by which we select and assess key suppliers based on risk profile.
Provisions in Standard Terms and Conditions TGB aims to ensure that high standards of ethical conduct are reflected within its supply chain by placing contractual obligations on all suppliers to comply with the Act. Specifically, these obligations include complying with all anti-slavery and human trafficking laws, maintaining their own policies and procedures and reporting any incidents or suspected incidents to TGB.
Whilst TFS’s business is the provision of financial services and it does not actively source or distribute physical goods as part of its primary activities, it is aware of its responsibilities towards modern slavery within its business and operating model. TFS considers and assesses any risks in its services supply chain and its appointed distributors responsibilities and obligations toward modern slavery are reflected clearly in their contracts of appointment.
TFS includes the ability of a potential supplier to comply with modern slavery requirements as part of its due diligence criteria in its vendor management policy.
Mandatory e-Learning Training Anti-slavery training forms an integral part of TGB’s compliance programme. TGB requires all staff to complete mandatory e-learning training on an annual basis to enhance knowledge on this important topic and to promote ethical business practice. This training equips all staff and contractors with the necessary skills to be able to identify and report any acts of modern slavery both within and outside of the workplace.
TGB shall be expanding its resources beyond online training modules in the next financial year, by publishing regular articles on its intranet and delivering presentations on the topic of modern slavery. Unfortunately, plans to run compliance activities in-person during March 2020 were required to be postponed due to the pandemic.
Modern Slavery Policy In line with its organisation’s stance on eliminating modern slavery, TGB’s Modern Slavery Policy provides a clear and robust framework for all staff and contractors to observe and adhere to. This sets a high standard for our key stakeholders to maintain and allows us to conduct business in an open and honest way. TGB expect all staff and its supply chain to abide by its policies and act responsibly in their commercial dealings to enable its organisation to foster an ethical corporate culture.
In addition, TGB has a whistleblowing policy in place which provides all staff and contractors with a simple process for reporting any concerns they may have in relation to modern slavery.
TFS’s modern slavery policy is freely and easily available for its employees to access. Its review and understanding is supported and encouraged. As well as reflecting legislative requirements, the policy also acknowledges TFS’s corporate approach to being a good corporate citizen and to acting ethically and with integrity. The same standards are expected of our suppliers and partners. Reporting processes for any suspected instances of modern slavery infringements are clearly stated.
Our Ongoing Commitment for Financial Year 2020/21 TGB and TFS are proud of the measures we take to eradicate modern slavery and continue to develop our procedures to identify and mitigate any actual or potential risks within our businesses and supply chains. We implement a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and strive to maintain a high-level of ethical conduct to uphold the integrity of our brands.
Over the next financial year, TGB shall continue to promote transparency in its commercial dealings by undertaking regular supplier audits and setting its expectations and standards through corporate policies and annual compliance activities.
As stated within the 2019 statement, TGB shall be exploring and embedding new initiatives to further heighten awareness of modern slavery within its business such as promoting the use of the Unseen App (www.unseenuk.org) which provides key information for spotting signs of modern slavery both inside and outside of the workplace.

Gender Pay Gap Report
Introduction & Commitment:
Toyota (GB) PLC is the sales and marketing company for Toyota and Lexus in the UK.
We wholeheartedly believe that diversity is critical to our future success. We look for input, impact and innovation from a range of talented people, irrespective of age, gender, race, religion or any other personal characteristic.
We pay men and women the same for work of equal value, and we regularly carry out internal and external benchmarking to ensure that this continues to be the case. We have a legacy Gender Pay Gap, but are taking proactive steps to ensure that, without discrimination of any kind, we continue to close the gap and help all our employees fulfil their maximum potential.
Our employees have consistently told us that they have Extraordinary levels of engagement, as measured by the Best Companies to Work For list. We are proud to have maintained this level over a number of years, and to have featured in the Sunday Times Top 100 list every year since 2015.
We want to be a company that people choose to work for, and choose to stay with. Our staff retention and engagement levels show that people love working here, and value the development and investment that they receive over the course of their career with TGB. We are continuing to develop the best possible employee experience, to enable everyone to be their best at work.
Equal PayEqual Pay is the right for men and women to be paid the same, when doing the same or equivalent work.
Gender Pay GapThe Gender Pay Gap is the average percentage difference between all men’s and all women's hourly pay, regardless of their role or level.
Closing the Gender Pay Gap
Traditionally the automotive industry has been less attractive to women, meaning that we need to work harder to attract female talent. We are consciously reviewing the way that we advertise vacancies to ensure that we do not inadvertently discourage women from applying.
We have increased the use of social media platforms to help people outside TGB to understand the type of employer we are, what we offer, and how we can help them to be their best.
We continue to link with external organisations to support our work, including the 30% club and the Automotive 30% club, as well as investing in ongoing development to enable our female employees to address any barriers to developing their careers. These internal and external networks help us to share knowledge and best practice, as well as to attract, engage, develop and retain great talent, increasing the levels of women in our business.
We want TOYOTA (GB) PLC to be an Employer of Choice as a company that people choose to work for and that people are happy to have chosen.
It is critical, therefore, that we continue to improve our gender mix by ensuring we attract more female candidates, and encourage and facilitate a higher proportion of women progressing through the organisation, which inevitably will close the Gender Pay Gap.
Our aspiration, therefore, without any form of positive discrimination, is for 30% of senior roles to be filled by women by 2030.
