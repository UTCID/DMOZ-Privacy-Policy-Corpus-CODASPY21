Privacy Statement
Introduction
P.S. Productions has created this privacy statement in order
to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
The following
discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices
for this website: Bar-None Drink Recipes.
In general it states
that, except in the case of contests where you explicitly give us
permission to provide your contact information to contest sponsors,
your personal information will only be known to two parties:
yourself
and P.S. Productions.
General Information
We use the information provided by your web browser
(your IP address, the last site that referred you to us, and
your browser version) to help diagnose problems with our
server, to administer our web site, and in the case of our
user forums to track abusive users.
We may also use cookies
to store your site navigation preferences (e.g. measurement
system, background colour, forum username and email).
Site Configuration
Our site configuration form requests that users give us
contact information (like their name and email address).
This is optional and is used to subscribe users to the
mailing lists that they have requested and to set their
default username and address for use in the forums. Users
may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the
opt-out/change section below.
Online Surveys
Our online surveys may ask visitors for demographic
information (like their age or gender).
This information
is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only
(i.e. your personal information can not be identified as belonging to you)
in order to allow us to better sell the advertising
that keeps our site online.
Contests
From time to time we run contests on our site in which we
may ask visitors for contact information (like their email
address) and demographic information (like their age or
gender). In some cases, in order for us to provide prizes for the contests
on our site, we are obligated to give a list of the entrant
information to the providers of those prizes.
If you do not
wish to have your information distributed, you may choose not
to enter the contests.
Public Forums
This site makes forums available to its users.
Please
remember that any information that is disclosed in these
areas becomes public information and you should exercise
caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
Third Party Advertising
We use Tribal Fusion, Google AdSense, Burst Media, Valua Click, Casale Media and other third-party advertising companies to serve
ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not
including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your
visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on
this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest
to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know
your choices about not having this information used by these companies,
please click here or

Third Party Cookies
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party
advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" or "beacon" on your browser.
Opt-Out/Update
Our site generally provides users the opportunity to
opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point
where we request information about the visitor.
The only
exception to this is contests, where the list of entrants is
given to the providers of the prizes.
The user may opt not
to enter the contest if they do not want their addresses
distributed.
This site also gives users the option of changing and
modifying information previously provided.
You can change your existing information in our database
or choose to be removed from any or all further contact by
sending us email at the address at the bottom of this page.
In the near future, this will also be available from our user
config page.
Disclaimer
Once information that a user has authorized us to provide
to a third party has left our control, we can not be held
responsible for removing that information from the third party's
database.
This site contains links to other sites.
Bar-None Drink Recipes is not responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
