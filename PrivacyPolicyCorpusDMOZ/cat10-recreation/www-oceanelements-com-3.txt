Your information:
We are committed to protecting the personal information that you give to us and informing you of how we use the information that we collect from you, and of course obtaining your consent to our disclosure of your information.
Your information” refers to details such as your name, contact details, travel preferences and special needs/disabilities/dietary requirements that you supply us or is supplied to us, including any information about other persons on your booking relating to the same.
Your information is collected when you request information from us, or you contact us and/or if we contact you, or if you ask for a holiday quotation or complete a booking with us. You are responsible for ensuring that other members of your party are aware of the content in this Privacy Policy, and that they consent to your acting on their behalf in all your dealings with us.
We will update your information whenever we get the opportunity to keep it current, complete, accurate and up to date
How we use Your Information.
1.    In order to enable us to provide our holidays, then for services such as booking of accommodation, flights, ski or resort extras, insurance etc., we may disclose your information to our third party providers (UK and overseas). To enable you to travel overseas, it may also be mandatory (as requested govt authorities) to disclose your information for immigration, security or any other reasons which they deem appropriate. Even if not mandatory, we might need to use your information to assist where appropriate, and we will do this at our discretion.
2.    We may have to disclose your information to our “group companies” (including overseas companies) in order to ensure efficient and accurate processing of your booking. We may also disclose your information to our data processing companies, or companies providing our travel and reservation software and systems. Other companies will include customer care companies, business management, re-organisation/structuring and /or for sale of our business (or our group companies), risk assessment, security and crime prevention/detection, research and analysis, marketing, monitoring, measuring and assessing customer purchasing preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection.

4.    Aspects of your information (for example health) may be considered “sensitive” or “personal” under the Data Protection Act 1998. We collect this information in order to  cater for your needs We will only accept such “personal information” on condition we have your positive consent. When booking a holiday with us you also agree for your insurers, agents and medical staff, to disclose relevant information (which may be sensitive personal information) to use in instances where we may need to act in the interests of a larger group. By way of example, this may be ensuring any contagion does not spread in the event of an illness which you or another person contracts.
5.    We will endeavour to prevent unauthorised disclosures of your personal information by other people, but we cannot be responsible for any unauthorised disclosures or other breaches of security, or indeed for the actions of others if the information was passed to them with your authority or with the authority of anybody other than us or our associated companies/organisations.

Please note: Outside of the EEA, (European Economic Area), controls on privacy may not be as strong or robust as they are in the UK
If you do not agree to the above then we will not be able to do any form of business with you or indeed to process your booking.
Marketing - Direct
