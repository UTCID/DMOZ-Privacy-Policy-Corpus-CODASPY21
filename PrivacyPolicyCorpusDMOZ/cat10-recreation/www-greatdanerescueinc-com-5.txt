You can help us help Great Danes.
The following is a list of essentials we need to continue our efforts:
Yarn for making crate pads
Crates - Dane size and colossal, gift certificates would be great
Crate pads
Blankets
Heartworm pills
Collars and Leads (leashes)
Postage stamps - ALWAYS in need of stamps, we send out a lot of info and applications
Ink Cartridges
Gift certificates for office Max or Staples
You know those nice thank you/ blank cards you get from charities that get thrown in the garbage? To help save money, we use those for thank you notes to donators and supporters
Copier paper
Telephone calling cards - now that we're covering AL and Canada too, we're spending even more on phone calls
An RV for transportation would be great now that we're covering so much area.
Dog toys sufficient for Great Danes
Gas cards
Printing of marketing pieces and event programs
Layout and printing of signs and banners
Promotional giveaways, prizes, or items for resale opportunities
Water and snacks for humans and dogs at events (Michigan, Indiana, Canada, & Alabama)
Advertisement (in print and online media)
Rental items for events: tables, linens, tents, etc.
Oh, and while I'm thinking of it, some property in the MI/IN area would be GREAT for a shelter!
Hey, you can donate it and hopefully take a tax deduction.....
