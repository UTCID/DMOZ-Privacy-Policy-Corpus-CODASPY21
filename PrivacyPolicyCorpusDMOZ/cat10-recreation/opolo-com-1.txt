Protecting Your Information
We are the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Any data that we store about you is kept behind a secure firewall in our database and is not accessible to the public in any way. Any sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number)that we collect from you is encrypted with SSL, a standard internet security measure. We do everything in our power to protect user data offline as well by restricting access to information to only those employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a Customer Care representative). All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices and are aware of the importance of keeping customer data secure and safe at all times.
The information you provide to us on this website is only used to send you our offers, and to process and ship your order.

This information is harvested from a secure area and encrypted for our customers’ protection. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others, except as otherwise disclosed in this statement. Although we use outside shipping companies to ship orders and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We value your privacy, and will never release any account or personal information to any third party unless we are given explicit authority to do so by you, our customer.
