However, we cannot ensure the security of any information that you transmit to us over the Internet and you do so at your own risk.Purpose of collecting personal informationWe use this information to provide our customers with products and services, including supporting and processing bookings, risk and fraud screening, authentication, and payments. We also use this information to improve our products and services.We additionally use this information to help customise and improve our customer’s experience when our customers visit our website or apps by presenting our customers with goods and services that are more likely to be of interest to our customersWe use some of the personal information our customers provide us to conduct some level of automated decision-making — for example, we use certain personal information (for example, IP addresses or payment information) to automatically suggest currency types and block certain potentially fraudulent transactions for a short period of time.When do we collect this information?We collect this information when our customers use or access our website or apps to communicate with us or place an order. It is also collected when you join our mailing list, subscribe to our magazines, subscribe to our newsletters or enter into promotions or competitions.Additionally, we partner with third parties who provide us information about our customers, for example, to help us screen out merchants associated with fraud.
