Legal & Privacy
Updates
We may update this information from time to time. With the exception of trivial changes such as spelling errors, we will post a notification in the Site News category when we do this.
Privacy and Cookies
We use Matomo Analytics, which is installed on our own server and does not send any information to third parties. This is used for determining which pages are used most, which search terms are used to reach the site, and which older web browsers still need to be supported, and is being processed under the “legitimate interests” basis of GDPR.
These statistics are reported in the aggregate (“20% of our visitors last month found us through Google” rather than “Fred Bloggs found us through Google”) and will not be used to identify individuals, used for marketing, nor made available outside of CAMRA.
Matomo sets a cookie containing a unique, randomly-generated number in order to track return visits, and uses your IP address to look up the general area the site is being accessed from. This is not very precise — UK users will probably show up as being in the city where their ISP is located. We cannot find where you live from this; this information is used to see which countries visitors are from, and to aid in filtering out automated visits when determining which browsers to support.
After the IP address has been looked up, it is anonymised before being stored: the rightmost two numbers are deleted, so 192.168.1.42 would be stored as 192.168.x.x. These records are automatically deleted after 60 days.
If you wish to opt out of the tracking, please scroll to the bottom of this page. Alternately, if your browser supports the “Do Not Track” system, turning this on will stop you from being tracked.
Our Privacy
These pages are maintained by volunteers, using their own resources and mostly at their own expense. Any email addresses published go to private systems, not CAMRA systems, even if the address ends with @westernsussexcamra.org.uk.
By accessing these pages, you agree that email addresses found on this site are private, non-business email addresses (unless explicitly noted as otherwise) and you agree that you will not send unsolicited advertising, sign them up to mailing lists, or otherwise treat these addresses as anything other than Personal Data as defined in the GDPR, and thus requiring specific opt-in for business mailings.
Cookies
If you log in as a registered user, cookies are used to store your authentication information.
To delete or refuse cookies, please see your browser’s documentation.
Please note that our maps are provided by OpenStreetMap. Google may set cookies over which we have no control. Please see the OpenStreetMap privacy policy for more details of what is done with these cookies.
Third-party sites
Links to sites outside the westernsussexcamra.org.uk domain point to content over which we have no control, and which may have changed since we posted the link. We accept no responsibility or liability for the contents of such sites. If you feel a link is inappropriate, please contact us.
As stated above, our maps are provided by OpenStreetMap. Changes beyond our control may cause maps to function differently or cease functioning altogether. Similarly, any inaccuracies in the map data are down to errors in OpenStreetMap (though you can log in and edit the maps yourself, if you want).
Copyright
The CAMRA logo is copyright CAMRA Ltd, and is used with permission. The maps are copyright Google. Comments posted on pages that permit this are copyright, and the responsibility of, the poster. All other textual and graphical content is copyright the Western Sussex branch of the Campaign for Real Ale, and all rights are reserved.

Disclaimers
The opinions expressed in this site are not necessarily those of the Campaign for Real Ale. User comments reflect the opinion of the poster, and not necessarily of anyone else.
The information and services on this site are provided “as is”, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. Western Sussex CAMRA hereby disclaims all warranties with respect to this information and services, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
In no event shall Western Sussex CAMRA be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, or damages for loss of profits, revenue, data or use, incurred by you or any third party, whether in an action in contract or tort, arising from your access to, or use of, this web site or any other linked web site.
All matters relating to your access to, or use of, this Web site shall be governed by English law and any legal proceedings arising will be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. Please note that we do not consent to the serving of legal documents by email.
This site is maintained by unpaid volunteers. While they will use their best efforts to respond to communications and make changes to the site, there may occasionally be delays caused by circumstances such as illness, heavy workload, holidays, and so on.
Advertising on this site
We have no plans to accept advertising on this site. If this changes, we’ll make a post letting you know. In the meantime, please don’t send us enquiries. Thanks.
