Military Program
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines & Coast Guard) serving on Active Duty who drive The Toll Roads without paying and receive a Notice of Toll Evasion in the mail are subject to pay the toll only, with no penalties assessed. An Active Duty member or his/her spouse must be the registered owner of the vehicle at the time of the toll evasion. To take advantage of The Toll Roads Military Program, send the toll evasion payment stub, a check for the amount of tolls only and a copy of proof of Active Duty in the return envelope. This program is for Active Duty members only and cannot be used for tolls incurred prior to January 2016.
