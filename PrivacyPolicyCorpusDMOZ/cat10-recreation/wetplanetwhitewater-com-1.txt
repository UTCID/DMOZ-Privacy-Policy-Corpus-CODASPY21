If the minor’s legal guardians will not be participating in the trip, the form may be read and signed by the parent or legal guardian in advance of the rafting trip or kayak course.

However, I-502 states that it is unlawful to open/consume a package of marijuana or marijuana infused product in view of the general public. The Wet Planet property and Wet Planet facilities are public spaces open to the general public.
