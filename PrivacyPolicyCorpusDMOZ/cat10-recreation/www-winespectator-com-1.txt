Introduction
Welcome to Wine Spectator's digital information network. We have developed these Terms of Service to govern your use and enjoyment of our digital products, including WineSpectator.com ("the Site"), Wine Spectator Mobile, any content found on the Site, any digital application edition of Wine Spectator magazine or other digital application published by Wine Spectator (each a "Digital Application"). Your use of any product in our network, accessed via any device, tells us you have read and agreed to these Terms of Service and to our Privacy Policy. Please read both these documents carefully.
Intellectual Property
You agree not to use any part of WineSpectator.com or any Wine Spectator Digital Application for any unlawful purpose. We reserve the right to terminate or restrict your access to the Site or any Digital Application if, in our opinion, your use of these products may violate any laws, infringe upon another person's rights or violate these Terms of Service. Also, we may refuse to grant you a user name that impersonates someone else, is protected by trademark or other proprietary right, law or is otherwise vulgar or offensive.
All information, content, services and software displayed on, transmitted through, or used in connection with the Site or a Digital Application—including for example, articles, reviews, directories, guides, text, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips, video, html, source and object code, trademarks, logos, and the like (collectively, the "Content"), as well as its selection and arrangement—is licensed or owned by M. Shanken Communications and/or its affiliated companies, licensors and suppliers, and is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. You may use the Content online only, and solely for your personal, non-commercial use, and you may download or print a single copy of any portion of the Content solely for your personal, non-commercial use. If you operate a website and wish to link to WineSpectator.com, you may do so provided you agree to cease such link upon request from Wine Spectator. All rights not expressly granted are expressly reserved. No other use is permitted without prior written permission of Wine Spectator. The permitted use described in this Paragraph is contingent on your compliance at all times with these Terms of Service.
You may not republish any portion of the Content in print or electronic media including, but not limited to, any Internet, Intranet or extranet site or Digital Application. You may not incorporate the Content in any database, compilation, archive or cache. You may not distribute or participate in the distribution of any Content to others, whether or not for payment or other consideration, and you may not modify, copy, frame, cache, reproduce, sell, publish, transmit, display or otherwise use any portion of the Content. You may not scrape, cut and paste or otherwise copy our Content without permission. You also agree not to decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software, Digital Application or other products or processes accessible through Wine Spectator, not to insert any code or product or manipulate the Content in any way that affects the user's experience, and not to use any data mining, data gathering or extraction method.
Wine Spectator, WineSpectator.com, Wine Spectator Mobile, The New York Wine Experience, The California Wine Experience, The New World Wine Experience, WineRatings+, VintageChart+ and Wine Spectator's Guide to Napa Valley are trademarks of M. Shanken Communications. All other trademarks appearing on the site are trademarks of their respective owners and our reference to them does not imply or indicate any approval or endorsement by their owners unless such approval or endorsement is expressly made.

Intellectual Property Violations
As a condition of your ability to access and use WineSpectator.com or our Digital Applications, you agree that you will not violate any intellectual property rights of Wine Spectator or M. Shanken Communications.
WineSpectator.com Membership and Registration
As a Member of winespectator.com, you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You also agree not to sell, transfer or assign your Membership or any Membership rights. We reserve the right to terminate your Membership if individuals from more than one household access WineSpectator.com using any single user name or password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your computer so others outside your household may not access WineSpectator.com using your name in whole or in part without our permission. If you believe someone has accessed WineSpectator.com using your user name and password without your authorization, email us immediately at wsonline@mshanken.com.
WineRatings+ Subscriptions
The premium version of Wine Spectator's WineRatings+ Digital Application—which includes access to our entire database of wine reviews and accompanying updates—requires a monthly subscription of $2.99, which is automatically renewed every 30 days. Payment will be charged to your iTunes/App Store account. You can turn off auto-renew at any time from your iTunes/App Store account settings; do so at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription to avoid being billed for the next period. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active period.
User-Provided Information and Content
By providing information to, communicating with, and/or placing material on WineSpectator.com and our Digital Applications, including, for example, communication during registration, communication on any WineSpectator.com forums, message, commenting, rating or chat area, posting any content, placing any classified advertisement, entering any contests, etc., you represent and warrant: (1) you own or otherwise have all necessary rights to the content you provide and the rights to use it as provided in this Terms of Service; (2) all information you provide is true, accurate, current and complete, and does not violate these Terms of Service; and, (3) the content will not cause injury to any person or entity. Using a name other than your own legal name is prohibited (except in those specific areas of WineSpectator.com that specifically allow unique, fictitious names, e.g., certain forums, message boards and chat rooms).
For all such information and material, you grant WineSpectator.com, our Digital Applications, affiliates and related entities, including Wine Spectator and M. Shanken Communications, Inc., a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, copy, modify, display, archive, store, distribute, reproduce and create derivative works from such information, in any form, media, software or technology of any kind now existing or developed in the future. Without limiting the generality of the previous sentence, you authorize M. Shanken Communications, Inc. to share the information across all M. Shanken Communications, Inc. affiliated Web sites, to include the information in a searchable format accessible by users of WineSpectator.com, other WineSpectator.com sites and Digital Applications, and to use your name and any other information in connection with its use of the material you provide. You also grant M. Shanken Communications, Inc. the right to use any material, information, ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in any communication you send to us for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to developing, manufacturing and marketing products using such information. All rights in this paragraph are granted without the need for additional compensation of any sort to you.
Please note Wine Spectator does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas for use or publication, and is not responsible for the similarity of any of its content or programming in any media to materials or ideas transmitted to WineSpectator.com. Should you send any unsolicited materials or ideas, you do so with the understanding no additional consideration of any sort will be provided to you, and you are waiving any claim against Wine Spectator and its affiliates regarding the use of such materials and ideas, even if material or an idea is used that is substantially similar to the idea you sent.
Transactions and E-Commerce
During your visit to our site you may elect to engage in a transaction involving the purchase of a product, such as a subscription to Wine Spectator Magazine, a print or online advertisement or other tangible goods and services. To serve you most efficiently, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often handled by a third party processing agent, bank or distribution institution. While in most cases, transactions are completed without difficulty, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet or offline. If you're concerned about online credit card safety, in most cases a telephone number will be made available so you can call us and place your order by phone. Wine Spectator cannot take responsibility for the success or security of transactions undertaken or processed by third parties.
On occasion, a product or service may not be available at the time or the price as it appears in an advertisement. In such event, or in the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error, technology effort, error in the date or length of publication, or error in pricing or product information received from our advertisers or suppliers, you agree Wine Spectator is not responsible for such errors or discrepancies.
Other Specifics About Interactive Areas (Comments, Ratings, Message Boards, Chat Areas, Automated Posting of Classified or Other Advertising, etc.)
WineSpectator.com comments sections, ratings, forums, chat rooms and other such interactive areas are provided to give users an interesting and stimulating forum to express their opinions and share ideas and information. Given the nature of WineSpectator.com and the volume of messages and postings, WineSpectator.com cannot and does not monitor all of the material posted or transmitted by users and third party information providers. To protect your safety, please use your best judgment when using these forums. We particularly discourage divulging personal phone numbers and addresses or other information that can be used to identify or locate you. If you make such disclosures either through comments, postings on the forums, chat rooms, in classified advertising you place or in other interactive areas, or to third parties in any communication, you do so fully understanding the consequences of such disclosures and with a knowing consent that such information could be used to identify you. WineSpectator.com reserves the right to delete, move or edit any communications at any time, for any reason or in its discretion, but has no obligation to review or remove any such content.
Posting Rules
Interactive areas, comments, ratings, forums, chat rooms, etc., are intended to encourage public debate. We expect people to differ—judgment and opinion are subjective things—and we encourage freedom of speech and a marketplace of ideas. But by using these areas of WineSpectator.com, you are participating in a community that is intended for all our users. Therefore, we reserve the right to remove any content posted on our site at any time for any reason.

If any of these rules or future changes are unacceptable to you, you may cancel your WineSpectator.com membership by sending an email to: wsonline@mshanken.com. Cancellation policies and procedures for Digital Applications are governed by the stores or platforms on which they are sold. Your continued use of the service now, or following any changes to these Terms of Service will indicate acceptance by you of such rules, changes or modifications.
These Terms of Service and any other Terms and Conditions of Service on WineSpectator.com and our Digital Applications constitute the entire agreement between you and Wine Spectator.
