Pebble Beach Company reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification hereunder.

10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
These Terms are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of such state and are binding upon the parties hereto in the United States and worldwide. You and Pebble Beach Company agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.
YOU AND PEBBLE BEACH COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
YOU AND PEBBLE BEACH COMPANY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN THE MANNER SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 10 AND THAT YOU AND PEBBLE BEACH COMPANY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW. RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
Any dispute between you and Pebble Beach Company and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates arising from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of these Terms to arbitration (collectively, “Covered Disputes“) will be settled by binding arbitration in the State of California administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its rules (including its rules and procedures for consumer-related disputes) in effect on the date thereof (“AAA Rules”). Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60 days’ advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Pebble Beach Company will provide such notice by email to the email address that you provided when you created your Profile and you must provide such notice to Pebble Beach Company by email at disputes@pebblebeach.com.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, Pebble Beach Company will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you. If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Pebble Beach Company for all fees associated with the arbitration that Pebble Beach Company paid on your behalf which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA Rules.
A single arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. The arbitrator’s decision must be with written explanation and remain confidential. Pebble Beach Company and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 10 is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration per permitted hereunder). Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred. For purposes of this Section 10, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).
