Introduction
These Terms of Use for Mobile Applications are in addition to and in supplement of the Terms of Use of our website (www.seatow.com) ("Website"), and govern our mobile applications ("Applications") for iPhone, iPad and other devices using the iPhone OS ("Apple® Applications") and for devices using another OS ("Other Applications").
The Website is operated, and the Applications provided by Sea Tow Services International, Inc. ("we" or "us").
Our Apple Applications may be downloaded from the App Store, which is operated and owned by Apple Inc. and other companies within its group ("Apple”).
We will refer to the Website and Applications together as the "STSI Media" (and by referring to the STSI Media, we intend also to refer to any indices, data, information or other material contained in, or accessible via, the STSI Media).
Your use of the STSI Media will be subject to these terms and by using the STSI Media you agree to be bound by them.
We reserve the right to change these terms from time to time by putting the new terms on our website. These terms were last updated on November 12, 2019.
Access to STSI Media
It is your responsibility to ensure your computer or mobile device meets all the necessary technical specifications to enable you to access and use the STSI Media. Apple Applications are only licensed for use on a device owned or controlled by you and using the Apple iPhone OS, so you must make sure that you use an appropriate device to access and use any Apple Application. Other Applications may only be used on a device owned or controlled by you running the OS for which the Other Application concerned was designed.
We may, from time to time, restrict access to certain features, parts or content of the Website, or the entire Website.
Operation of the STSI Media
We cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operability of the STSI Media. There may be times when all of, or certain features, parts or content of, the STSI Media, becomes unavailable (whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis) or are modified, suspended or withdrawn by us, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any unavailability, modification, suspension or withdrawal of any STSI Media, or any features, parts or content of any STSI Media.
What you are allowed to do
You may only use the STSI Media for your own non-commercial personal use and only in accordance with these terms.
Subject to the following sections, you may retrieve and display content from the STSI Media on a computer or mobile device, print pages from our website and store the STSI Media in electronic form.
Additional terms may also apply to certain features, parts or content of the STSI Media and, where they apply, are set out in these terms, incorporated by reference, or will be displayed before you access the relevant features, parts or content.  The following are incorporated by reference: (a) Sea Tow Membership Agreement, found at: seatow.com; (b) Google® Maps Terms and Conditions, found at: m.google.com/tos_maps; and
What you are not allowed to do
Except to the extent expressly set out in these terms, you are not allowed to:
(a)
create (whether for yourself or someone else) any product or service which seeks to match the performance of, or the capital or income value of which is related to, any STSI Media;
(b)
republish, redistribute or re-transmit any STSI Media;
(c)
copy or store the STSI Media other than for your own personal non-commercial use and as may occur incidentally in the normal course of use of your browser or mobile device;
(d)
store the STSI Media (including pages of our website) on a server or other storage device connected to a network or create a database by systematically downloading and storing any data from the STSI Media;
(e)  remove or change any content of the STSI Media or attempt to circumvent security or interfere with the proper working of the STSI Media or any servers on which it is hosted;
(f)
create links to our website from any other website, without our prior written consent, although you may link from a website that is operated by you provided the link is not misleading or deceptive and fairly indicates its destination, you do not imply that we endorse you, your website, or any products or services you offer, you link to (and do not frame or replicate) the home page of our website, and the linked website does not contain any content that is unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, pornographic, obscene, vulgar, indecent, offensive or which infringes on the intellectual property rights or other rights of any third party; or
(g)
otherwise do anything that it is not expressly permitted by these terms.
You must only use the STSI Media and anything available via the STSI Media for lawful purposes (complying with all applicable laws and regulations), in a responsible manner, and not in a way that might damage our name or reputation or that of any of our franchisees or licensees.
All rights granted to you under these terms will terminate immediately in the event that you are in breach of any of them.
To do anything with the STSI Media that is not expressly permitted by these terms, you will need a separate license from us. Please contact us via info@seatow.com.
Apple Applications
If the STSI Media that you access and use is an Apple Application, then:
(a)
the Apple Application may only be accessed and used on a device owned or controlled by you and using the Apple iPhone OS;
(b)
you acknowledge and agree that:
(1)
Apple has no obligation at all to provide any support or maintenance services in relation to the Apple Application. If you have any maintenance or support questions in relation to the Apple Apps, please contact us, not Apple, using the contacting us details at the end of these terms;
(2)
although these terms are entered into between us and you (and not Apple), Apple, as a third party beneficiary under these terms, will have the right to enforce these terms against you;
(3)
except as otherwise expressly set out in these terms, any claims relating to the possession or use of the Apple Application are between you and us (and not between you, or anyone else, and Apple); and
(4)
in the event of any claim by a third party that your possession or use (in accordance with these terms) of the Apple Application infringes any intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible or liable to you in relation to that claim;
(c)
you represent and warrant that:
(1) you are not, and will not be, located in any country that is the subject of a US Government embargo or that has been designated by the US Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and
(2) you are not listed on any US Government list of prohibited or restricted parties; and
(3) if the Apple Application that you have purchased does not conform to any warranty applying to it, you may notify Apple, which will then refund the purchase price of the Apple Application to you. Subject to that, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple does not give or enter into any warranty, condition or other term in relation to the Apple Application and will not be liable to you for any claims, losses, costs or expenses of whatever nature in relation to the Apple Application or as a result of you or anyone else using the Apple Apps or relying on any of its content.
Intellectual property rights
All intellectual property rights in the STSI Media and in any content of the STSI Media (including graphics, software, photographs and other images, videos, sound, words, phrases, logos and other trademarks; text, content, layout, and other copyright-protected works; business and nautical methods, vendors, memberships and other proprietary, trade secrets) are owned by us. Except as expressly set out here, nothing in these terms gives you any rights in respect of any intellectual property owned by us and you acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by downloading or using any STSI Media. In the event you print off, copy or store any STSI Media (only as permitted by these terms), you must ensure that any copyright, trade mark or other intellectual property right notices contained in the original content are reproduced.
Content and its intended use
We may change the format and content of the STSI Media from time to time. You agree that your use of the STSI Media is on an “as is” and “as available” basis and at your sole risk.
While we try to make sure that all information contained in the STSI Media (other than any user-generated content) is correct, it is not intended to amount to authority or advice on which reliance should be placed.
The STSI Media is not intended to constitute or form the basis of any advice (professional or otherwise) or to be used in, or in relation to, any decision or transaction.
We do not accept any liability (regardless of how it might arise) for any claim or loss arising from any information, advice or material given, the content of STSI Media, or the consequences of your use or reliance thereupon.
We do not enter into any terms or make any representations as to the accuracy, completeness, currency, correctness, reliability, integrity, quality, fitness for purpose or originality of any content of the STSI Media and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all implied warranties, conditions or other terms of any kind are hereby excluded. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we accept no liability for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of you or anyone else using the STSI Media or relying on any of its content.
We cannot and do not guarantee that any content of the STSI Media will be free from viruses and/or other code that may have contaminating or destructive elements. It is your responsibility to implement appropriate IT security safeguards (including anti-virus and other security checks) to satisfy your particular requirements as to the safety and reliability of content.
Your personal information
Use of your personal information submitted to us (whether via our website or otherwise) is governed by our privacy policy, incorporated by reference, and found at: seatow.com.
External links
Our website may, from time to time, include links to external sites. We have included links to these sites to provide you with access to information and services that you may find useful or interesting. We are not responsible for the content of these sites or for anything provided by them and do not guarantee that they will be continuously available. The fact that we include links to such external sites does not imply any endorsement of, or association with, their operators.
General
You agree that these terms, and access to and use of STSI Media shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, and we can only be sued in the State of New York.  You further agree to personal jurisdiction in the State of New York.  Nothing, however, shall prevent or limit us from bringing proceedings to protect our intellectual property and other rights before any competent court.
Do not manipulate while driving or in an unsafe position. Location will generally take 2-5 minutes to acquire and update. Accuracy will vary based solely on the capabilities and outdoor location of your wireless phone, Phone GPS and wireless carrier. The STSI App and Vessel Locator Notification is not for emergency use; always use a VHF radio and GPS while on the water. In case of emergency call the U.S. Coast Guard on your VHF Radio (Channel 16) or 911 on your phone. STSI will only receive cell phone number and data entered in the Your Information screen when you hit the "Call Sea Tow or Call Us" option. Disabling WiFi and Wireless Location assistance settings on some Android phones may improve accuracy. Location data may be from mixed sources, may not be accurate and mapping functions will not work when outside cellular carrier range. Use is always at your own risk. Sea Tow will neither sell nor distribute your Settings information or location to outside parties.  Information received by Sea Tow during a call will only be used for record keeping purposes and dispatch. You are subject to third party’s policies when they receive your information via our site.  Certain services may require phone service, data access or text messaging capability, and will be subject to your carrier’s rates and costs.
Contacting us
Please submit any questions you have about these terms and conditions or any problems concerning the STSI Media by email to appsupport@seatow.com, by telephone at 800-4-SEATOW (800-473-2869), or write to us at:
