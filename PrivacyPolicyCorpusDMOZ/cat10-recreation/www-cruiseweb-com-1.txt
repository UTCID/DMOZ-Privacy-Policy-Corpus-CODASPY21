9. PRIVACY & PERSONAL INFORMATION: The Cruise Web fully respects your privacy, therefore we've developed a Privacy Policy that explains how your personal information (as defined under applicable law) is collected, stored, used, shared and disclosed. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected through the use of The Cruise Web's Internet sites, applications and online services and via direct communication between you and The Cruise Web, and does not cover any information collected at any other website, application or service. Usage of The Cruise Web Services constitutes your agreement with our Privacy Policy.
10. TRAVEL DOCUMENTS: Proof of citizenship and photo identification will be required for your vacation. A valid US passport may also be required for your travel. The United States Department of State has recently changed documentation requirements for travel outside of the United States, and continues to review these requirements. Please visit the State Department website at www.travel.state.gov, for the official and most up to date documentation requirements, and also for instructions on how to renew or obtain a passport. You may also contact the National Passport Information Center toll free at 1-888-874-7793. (Non-US citizens should check with their local consulate to determine the specific documents required for travel.) The first and last names on your reservation and/or invoice must match your passport. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable governmental regulations and requirements, including Customs and Immigration requirements, at all destination points. You are responsible for, and release CW from any and all liability regarding, compliance with passport, visa, vaccination or other entry/exit requirements and payment of any charges, fees, duties, taxes or assessments related to your travel or your use of this Web Site. CW reserves the right to issue all ticketing as e-ticketing. With e-ticketing, you simply present proper identification at the pier and/or airport, along with your confirmation number, to receive your boarding tickets.
11. DEPOSITS, PAYMENTS, CANCELLATION FEES, AND REFUNDS: Check payments should be made payable to "The Cruise Web, Inc." and mailed to The Cruise Web at 3901 Calverton Boulevard, Suite 350, Calverton, MD 20705. Credit card payments should be called in to CW at 1-800-377-9383, and will be processed by the cruise line and/or CW . For bookings not made online, your CW representative will orally outline the deposit and payment details of your particular reservation. All payments must be received by CW by the deadlines specified by the CW representative, or your reservation is subject to cancellation. If you pay by credit card, you agree to execute and return a credit card authorization form. Details of your reservation will be sent to you with your invoice. Please be sure to check the first and last names on the invoice to make sure that they match the names on your photo identifications. You should review your invoice package carefully, and must notify CW of any discrepancies in your invoice package within two business days of receiving this package. CW may offer you rebates or discounts from suppliers' actual rates, or may have net, group, or promotional rates to which CW adds commission and/or service fees. The CW total pricing quoted to you by a CW representative, as confirmed by your CW invoice, includes any and all commissions and service fees charged and/or earned by CW, although not detailed on the invoice. Unless otherwise specified in writing, cancelled reservations will be assessed a CW cancellation service fee equal to 15% of the invoice total (not including any insurance premium), plus all applicable supplier penalties, but in no event should the total fees/penalties exceed the reservation total. The CW portion of the cancellation service fee may be applied to a future cruise of equal or greater value to the cancelled cruise if booked within one year of the cancellation date.

OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS: In making reservations on travel suppliers via CW, you agree to be bound by each travel supplier's terms and conditions for the United States as set forth in that supplier's web site, brochures, tickets, passage contract, contract of carriage, or other travel documents, and agree to the U.S. policies of those suppliers. Supplier penalties are established by each individual supplier and vary in schedule and amount. Supplier policies may also vary for different countries. HOWEVER, reservations made with CW are always governed by each supplierâ€™s polices for the United States. If you have questions regarding these policies, please contact your CW cruise consultant.
13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This agreement represents the entire agreement between you and CW. Your making a reservation with CW, your retention of tickets, retention of travel documents, and your retention of invoice shall each individually or collectively constitute your express consent to the above terms and conditions. If any provision of these terms and conditions shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
14. GOVERNING LAW: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Maryland, without regard to conflict of laws provisions. You and CW agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes hereunder and venue in an appropriate local or federal court located in the state of Maryland.
