How we gather information about visitors to our websites
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you choose to participate and the services provided. You may provide information when you subscribe for our email newsletter, join our mailing list or join PJ’s Wine Connection.
We can only identify you personally if you give us this information voluntarily.
Like most websites, our web servers automatically record some general information about your visit, but do not recognise or record any Personally Identifiable Information about you. The information we record and use for statistical purposes is:

Cookies and Session Tracking
Whenever you visit a website anywhere, your browser sends information identifying basic information about the nature of your operating system and the browser you are using. We use cookies and session variables to track the popularity of each page on our site and to understand the overall direction of traffic. We do not analyse or record your individual choices. By understanding the general viewing trends of our visitors, we can design our web pages to make your viewing experience simpler and more user-friendly. Learning how you found us helps us understand what you were looking for on the internet and assists us in tailoring our site for your best viewing experience.
If you visit this website using one of our affiliates links, we use a cookie to keep track of your visit, so we can correctly pay the affiliate a commission if you make a purchase.
Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or it may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our website.
As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do, you may be unable to access certain sections of our website or you may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customise our websites features according to your preferences.
Your email address

We may need to supply your Personally Identifiable Information to other parties who work with us to provide a product or service to you.
We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in response to a court order, or at times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
Angas Plains Wines Pty Ltd reserves the right to change this policy at any time. If you are concerned about how your information is used, please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
