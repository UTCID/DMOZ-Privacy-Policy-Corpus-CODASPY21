Up to 7 days before set tour departure time;
If full payment has been made: Credit* of 125% on price paid to be put towards a future booking to be used within 15 months, or,
75% refund with the option of the remaining 25% being held for the customer as a deposit to put towards any tour departing within 12 months, or,
If only deposit has been paid; transfer of deposit to any tour departing within 12months.
Less than 7 days before set departure time; unfortunately no refund or transfer available.
*Value of extra 25% credit cannot be used as part of a refund at a later date.
Passenger Requirements
All passengers MUST be aged 18 and over.
MacBackpackers tours have been designed for 18-40 year old backpackers and therefore the nature and style of the tour reflects this. Certain levels of activity and the style of language used whilst on tour may not be suitable for passengers outside this age bracket.
We go on hikes where the weather and terrain can be difficult at times. Please be aware of this. A good level of physical fitness may be needed and we recommend you bring sturdy shoes/boots and warm waterproof clothing.
By agreeing to our terms and conditions you recognise these elements of the tour.
MacBackpackers reserves the right to refuse carriage to anyone if it is felt that the individual cannot cope with the requirements of the trip and who may require services and facilities that MacBackpackers cannot guarantee will be available.
MacBackpackers reserves the right to refuse carriage to anyone that falls outwith the 18-40 age range unless the customer had directly contacted our booking office to discuss before completing their booking. If the customer has not directly contacted the booking office, is outwith the age range and is refused carriage then no refund will be given.
MacBackpackers reserves the right to refuse carriage to anyone who behaves in an unacceptable manner or is in an unsuitable condition to travel eg. drunk and disorderly. In such circumstance no refund will be offered.
Booking
Tour prices are for transport and driver-guide only. Accommodation, is pre-booked for you and unless stated otherwise, is not included in the price and should be paid independently to the hostels on arrival. You also have the option to pre-pay for your accommodation on tour by utilising the Express Check-in option at the point of booking.
Full payment for the tour must be received in order to confirm a booking. Bookings paid for by bank transfer will not be confirmed until the payment has cleared.
Alternatively a 25% non-refundable deposit can be paid to confirm a booking with the remaining amount, up to the full price of the booking, to be received no later than 31 days BEFORE the date of travel. You will receive two reminder emails to the email address provided for completion of your booking, if the final payment is not made in the time frame your booking will be automatically canceled resulting in the loss of your deposit. (Sorry!)
Those who have chosen to book a tour as a student must present a valid Student Identification card at the departure check-in point before boarding the tour. If a valid student card is not valid or not presented, then the customer agrees to pay the extra difference in the price of the tour. Student Discounts are only available on Standard Tours.
If a Discount Code is applicable the discount rate is calculated from the FULL original price of the tour departure even if the price of the tour has subsequently reduced.
It is the passenger’s responsibility to ensure that the details given in their confirmation email are correct.
Bookings are not confirmed until you have received email confirmation from MacBackpackers (in addition to any correspondence from our agents/payment gateway providers) with your booking reference and details of the tour departure – it is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that they have received this. In the event that confirmation has not been received within 24 hours of booking please contact our booking office directly on info@macbackpackers.com or telephone +44 (0)131 558 9900.
Bookings may be transferred to another tour (of the same or lesser value or to a more expensive tour if the customer pays the difference) for an admin fee of £10 per change (first change free of charge). All the transfers must be requested at least 14 full days prior to departure and are subject to availability. Special conditions may apply to non-standard departures (e.g. Festive & Easter packages). Please, notice, that it is not possible to transfer your booking to a departure date more than a year after your original travel date. To transfer your booking contact the booking office directly on +44 (0)131 558 9900.
We use TourCMS to securely handle our bookings and WorldPay to securely process the payments. You can find WorldPay's Privacy Notice here.

Data Protection
At MacBackpackers, we value your privacy. In order to get you on tour to explore Bonnie Scotland and to make sure that all your travel arrangements run smoothly, we need to use the personal information, which you provide to us, such as, name, contact details, any special requirements, etc. Furthermore, we are required to pass this information on to third parties, such as the hostels and other providers relevant to your booking. But do not worry. We will not hand over your information on to anyone who is not directly involved in providing or arranging any product or service related to your booking.
If you decide to opt-in to special offers and promotions, we use your information to keep you updated about our products and services from time to time. Your contact details will not be passed on to any third parties, and you can unsubscribe anytime.

Travelling
Luggage considered to be excessive may not be carried due to limited space on the bus, particularly large hard suitcases. Excess luggage can be stored in the Edinburgh hostel you depart from for the duration of the tour [please arrange this well before departure time].
It is your responsibility to ensure that you arrive in good time for the departure. MacBackpackers cannot delay departures for late arrivals however we will always assist you, where possible, to join the tour at a later stage. In this instance, any additional costs will be incurred by the passenger and not MacBackpackers.
All return times are approximate and may be affected by factors beyond our control eg. weather, road-works or even breakdown. MacBackpackers cannot accept responsibility for any ongoing travel tickets lost as a result of a late return to Edinburgh and always advise that you stay in Edinburgh upon your return.
Insurance
Personal travel insurance is not included in the price of the tour. The company strongly recommends you take out comprehensive travel insurance cover for cancellation, medical expenses, personal accident, personal baggage/belongings, money and public liability before you travel.
Accommodation
Accommodation whilst on tour is reserved for you and all you have to do is pay on arrival. You also have the option to pre-pay for your accommodation on tour by utilising the Express Check-in option at the point of booking.
Accommodation is dormitory (bunk-bed) style in quality independent hostels.
If you book alternative accommodation, you must give written notice at least 7 days in advance. Failure to do so may result in you being charged for the accommodation we have reserved for you.
Please ensure that you carry a valid passport in order to check into the hostels. Original documents only. Other forms of documentation may be accepted subject to prior arrangement with MacBackpackers. You may be refused accommodation if you do not carry the correct ID.

What an amazing 5 days! This doesn't even feel like a "tour" in the traditional sense, but more like a bunch of awesome people road tripping around the picturesque Scottish Highlands. Our guide Richard was so knowledgeable…
