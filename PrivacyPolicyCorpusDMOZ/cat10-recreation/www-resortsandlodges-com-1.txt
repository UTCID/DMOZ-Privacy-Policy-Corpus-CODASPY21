Terms of Use
Last Modified: January 26, 2014
The www.ResortsandLodges.com website (the “Website”) and ResortsandLodges.com mobile application (the “Application”) are
made available by Travelnet Solutions Inc., a Minnesota corporation, d/b/a ResortsandLodges.com (“RAL”). By accessing and/or
using the Website or the Application, or registering for a user account (“Account”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use
(“Terms of Use”). If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, do not continue to access and/or use the Website or the Application.
THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBTIRATION PROVISION (SECTION 24), CLASS ACTION
WAIVER (SECTION 24) AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER (SECTION 25) THAT AFFECT YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN
COURT, AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS ACTION AND IN FRONT OF A JURY. PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS OF USE
CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU CONTINUE TO ACCESS AND/OR USE THE WEBSITE OR THE APPLICATION.
RAL may modify these Terms of Use from time to time, without notice, and any such modifications shall be effective immediately
upon posting of the modified version. If you continue to access and/or use the Website, the Application or your Account you accept
such modified terms. If you do not agree to such modified terms, do not continue to access and/or use the Website, the Application or
your Account.
1. Compliance.
To ensure you are not violating any part of these Terms of Use, RAL recommends that you always review the
current Terms of Use each time you visit the Website or the Application before you continue to access or use the Website, the
Application or your Account. All access to and use of the Website, the Application, your Account and the information contained
on or provided through the Website and the Application is subject to these Terms of Use.
2. General Use.
The Website and the Application are made available, subject to these Terms of Use, to allow lodging company
users, including, but not limited to, resorts, hotels, motels and inns (collectively “Lodging Companies”), to post listings for
lodging accommodations that they own or manage which are available for rent (“Accommodations”) for end users seeking to
research, plan and book such Accommodations (collectively “Travelers”). In order for a Traveler to write a review of a
particular Accommodation, compare Accommodations, book an Accommodation, sign up for RAL’s newsletter or track favorite
destinations, a Traveler must register for an Account, and in order for a Lodging Company to list an Accommodation, it must
register for an Account. You may view Accommodations without an Account. Subject to these Terms of Use, and unless
otherwise agreed by RAL, RAL grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable license to
access and use the Website and the Application solely for those purposes described in this Section 2 and for your internal benefit.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, you shall have no other rights to the Website or the Application, and no other
rights shall be implied.
3. Accounts.
You may not have more than one (1) Account. The security, confidentiality and integrity of your Account and
password are your sole responsibility and you agree to bear all liability for the same as well as all use and/or charges incurred
from use of the Website or the Application with your Account and/or password. You are responsible for taking all reasonable
steps to ensure that no unauthorized person shall have access to your Account or password. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, you hereby authorize RAL to use and disclose your Account information if required by applicable law or where
necessary to enforce these Terms of Use and/or to protect any of RAL’s or other parties’ legal rights. By registering for an
Account you hereby authorize RAL to use your Account information to send you commercial communications, including, but not
limited to, marketing materials related to the Website or the Application; provided that you may unsubscribe from such
communications by logging into Account and selecting unsubscribe.
4. Accommodation Booking – Lodging Companies.
The Lodging Company will be notified in the event a Traveler requests
to book its Accommodation(s). The notification will include the name of the Traveler, the Accommodation and the requested
date(s) of booking. In such an event, the booking request (a) will be accepted if the Lodging Company has requested that RAL
allow for automatic booking, or (b) must be accepted or rejected by the Lodging Company within twenty-four (24) hours of the
initial request, and if not accepted within such time period, it will be deemed rejected.
5. Accommodation Booking – Travelers.
Travelers who request a booking hereby authorize RAL, in its sole discretion, to
obtain a preauthorization of the Traveler’s credit card for the Charged Fees (as defined below) and/or to charge such credit card a
nominal amount to verify its validity. If a requested booking is rejected pursuant to the process described in Section 4 above, any
credit card preauthorization will be cancelled. If a requested booking is accepted pursuant to the process described in Section 4
above, Travelers agree to pay the Total Fees for the applicable Accommodation and authorize RAL to charge and collect the
Charged Fees by charging the applicable credit card or other authorized account. Once the booking is complete, Travelers will
receive a booking confirmation email.
6. Accommodation Fees.
The fees for each listed Accommodation include the rental fees charged by the Lodging Company
(the “Rental Fees”), the service fees charged by RAL pursuant to a separate agreement between RAL and the Lodging Company
(the “Service Fee”) and any applicable taxes, fees, assessments, charges and duties (the “Taxes” and collectively with the Rental
Fees and Service Fee, the “Total Fees”); provided that RAL will only charge and collect the Service Fee, the Taxes and one (1)
night of the Rental Fees (collectively the “Charged Fees”) and the Traveler will be obligated to pay the Lodging Company
directly for the balance of the Total Fees. Each Lodging Company hereby appoints RAL and its successors and assigns as its
agent for the sole purpose of collecting payments made by Travelers for Accommodations on behalf of each Lodging Company,
and remitting the applicable portion of the Charged Fees to the Lodging Company; provided that RAL does not assume any
liability for acts or omissions of the Lodging Company or its agents by reason of this appointment. As of the date of these Terms
of Use, RAL does not charge fees for listing Accommodations on the Website or the Application. However, RAL reserves the
right, in its sole discretion, to charge and collect such listing fees from Lodging Companies. Any changes to these Terms of Use
to allow for such listing fees shall be implemented through the amendment process described above
7. Cancellations and Refunds.
If a requested booking is rejected pursuant to Section 4 above, any amounts paid by the
Traveler to RAL for the cancelled booking will be refunded to the Traveler and any credit card preauthorization for the cancelled
booking will be cancelled. In all other cases, the Charged Fees are non-refundable. If a Traveler cancels an accepted booking (if
applicable pursuant to the Lodging Company’s separate agreement, terms or conditions referenced in Section 9 below) or a
Lodging Company cancels a booking, refunds shall be governed by the applicable Lodging Company’s refund policy, and the
Traveler must be pursue any refund through the applicable Lodging Company pursuant to such policy and not through RAL;
provided that in no such event shall the Service Fee be refundable. Each Traveler acknowledges and agrees that in such a
scenario, RAL and the applicable Lodging Company may not be required to refund any part of the Total Fees.
8. Taxes.
Each Lodging Company agrees to provide a completed Form W-9 to RAL at the time of registration for its Account.
You shall be solely responsible for any and all federal, state and local taxes, fees, assessments, charges and duties imposed on
your use of the Website, the Application, the rental of Accommodations and other transactions contemplated by these Terms of Use.
9. Additional Terms.
The applicable Lodging Company is solely responsible for its Accommodations, including, but not
limited to, any Accommodations booked by Travelers through the Website or the Application. Travelers acknowledge and agree
that they must enter into a separate agreement with the applicable Lodging Company in connection with the Accommodation and/
or will be required to accept separate terms and conditions imposed by the Lodging Company in connection with the
Accommodation. RAL is not a party to such separate agreement, terms or conditions and shall have no obligation to abide by
them and hereby disclaims all liability pursuant thereto. The applicable Traveler is solely responsible for any such obligations
and shall abide by the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Travelers acknowledge and agree that RAL is appointed as each
Lodging Company’s agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments from Travelers for Accommodations, and that upon
payment in full of the Charged Fees to RAL for the applicable Accommodation, the applicable Traveler’s payment obligations for
the Charged Fees to the Lodging Company shall be satisfied and the Traveler shall owe the Lodging Company the balance of the Total Fees.

shifting provision, this provision shall be deed severed from these Terms of Use and the remainder of these Terms of Use will
remain in full force and effect.
28. Suspension, Termination & Cancellation.

Section headings are not to be considered part of these Terms of Use. They are included solely for
convenience and not intended to be full or accurate descriptions of the content hereof. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, should any provision of these Terms of Use be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity will not invalidate the whole
of these Terms of Use, but rather that invalid provision will be amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect
as the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect; provided that if the last
sentence of Section 24 above is held invalid or unenforceable in a particular scenario, all of Section 24 above shall be deemed
severed from these Terms of Use for such scenario. Each party hereto agrees to execute and deliver such other documents,
instruments and agreements and to take such further action as is reasonably requested by the other party to consummate or to
evidence the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between

discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no warranties,
representations or agreements among the parties with respect to subject matter hereof, except as set forth or referred to herein.
Nothing in these Terms of Use is intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto, and their respective heirs,
successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of these Terms of Use. Any and all rights and
obligations contained in these Terms of Use which by their nature and/or context are intended to survive termination of these
Terms of Use shall so survive, including, but not limited to, the limitation of liability, disclaimer and indemnification. No breach
or right under these Terms of Use may be waived unless in writing signed by the waiving party. The Website and the Application
