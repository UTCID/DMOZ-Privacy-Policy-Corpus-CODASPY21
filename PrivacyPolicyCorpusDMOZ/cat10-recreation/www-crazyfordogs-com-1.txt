Privacy statement for crazyforDOGS (sm)
Guestbook and Dog Tails: In both these departments, we ask for
your name.
You are free to use as much or as little of your name as
you like -- first name only, last name only, initials.
We do not
use your name for any other purpose besides identifying who made
the Guestbook or Tail entry.
Postcards: The postcard script asks for your name and email
address as well as the name and email address of your recipient.
These are used strictly for email and identifying you to the recipient,
and for no other purpose.
Newsletter: The newsletter subscription page asks for your name
and email.
This information is kept just for our newsletter and is not
given to anyone else.
Sirius of the Week: You may include as much of your name as
you wish along with your dog's biography, or you may remain anonymous.
