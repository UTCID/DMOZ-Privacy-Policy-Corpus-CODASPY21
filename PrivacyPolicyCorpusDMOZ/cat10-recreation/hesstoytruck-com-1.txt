Terms
These Terms and Conditions were updated on October 8, 2018.
These terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) located at www.hesstoytruck.com govern your access to, and use of, the Hess toy truck websites, mobile applications, and/or other services and applications that link to these Terms and Conditions, including Hess social media pages on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms (collectively and individually, the “Website” or “website”), including, without limitation, the Hess Toy Truck online store portion of the Website (located at https://hesstoytruck.com/) (the “Online Store”) and constitute an agreement between you and Hess Corporation (Hess Corporation, together with its affiliates, may be referred to herein, as “Hess” “we” or “us” and/or other correlative terms).
PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE WEBSITE, AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY LOCATED AT https://hesstoytruck.com/Hess/privacy-policy/, AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE RULES, POLICIES, AND TERMS THAT MAY APPLY TO CERTAIN SERVICES, SALES, PROMOTIONS OR CONTESTS OFFERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE BEFORE PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM THE ONLINE STORE OR OTHERWISE USING THE WEBSITE. YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY USE OF THE ONLINE STORE) CONFIRMS YOUR UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE WEBSITE.
1. Products, Content and Specifications: Hess may from time to time offer for sale and sell certain products and/or services on the Website, but the inclusion of any products or services on the Online Store or elsewhere on the Website at a particular time does not imply, represent or warrant that any of these products or services, if any, will be in stock or otherwise available at any time. All features, content, specifications, products and prices of any products or services described, depicted or otherwise contained on the Online Store or elsewhere on the Website are subject to change at any time without notice. We also reserve the right, as we may determine in our sole discretion and without prior notice or any other obligation, to limit the quantity of products that may be purchased by an individual on the Online Store and/or elsewhere on the Website and/or to refuse service to any customer that has not or does not comply with these Terms and Conditions. We are not responsible for, and will not honor, any prices specified on any third party websites or elsewhere for any such services or products. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including, without limitation, minimum age requirements) in connection with the use of the Website, including, without limitation, the Online Store and in connection with any purchase of any product or service, including, without limitation, the provision of any information in connection with such purchase and with respect to the possession, use and sale of anything purchased from the Website. By placing an order on the Website, you hereby represent and agree that any products or services ordered on the Website are being purchased, and will be used, only in a lawful manner and for private non-commercial uses and may not be used for any public or other commercial purposes (including, without limitation, for any commercial resale or promotion) and will not be reproduced in any form, manner or medium (whether now or hereafter existing) without our express written consent.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, due to limited supply, the purchase of Hess Toy Trucks via the Website and the Online Store is limited to 12 trucks per customer or address unless otherwise stated. Any attempt to exceed this quantity, for example by making multiple orders, by making minor modifications to your name or address, or by ordering under multiple names at a single address, or similar, is a material breach of these Terms and Conditions. In the event of such breach, we may exercise any or all of the following remedies: (i) cancel your order in whole or in part; (ii) require you to return any excess products at your own expense (by deducting cost or estimated cost of the return from any refund due); (iii) charge a processing fee of $9.99 for each cancelled and/or returned product (by deducting from any refund due); (iv) terminate or suspend your account or your access to the Websites; and (v) exercise any other remedies available to us at equity or at law.
2. Shipping Limitations: When an order for any product is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by you as long as that shipping address is compliant with any shipping restrictions contained on the purchase form on the Website and as may be required or otherwise specified by our shipping partners. All purchases from the Online Store are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the Website pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. Address Validation: Use of a verified suggested address is intended to increase the likelihood of successful delivery, but will not guarantee successful delivery to your address. While we may choose to assist you in replacing an undelivered order when address validation is used, we will not replace or assist in replacement of any order when you choose not to use a verified suggested address. Signature Required Shipment: Use of signature required shipping is intended to increase the likelihood of successful delivery and avoid delivery package theft. While we may choose to assist you in replacing a shipment that was delivered but not received by you, we will not replace or assist in replacing any shipment that carrier has identified as delivered if the recommendation to use signature required shipping was declined.
3. Accuracy of Information; Modifications; Order Confirmation and Cancellation: For any order placed on our website, once submitted the order is final and cannot be cancelled or modified by you in any way, including quantity ordered nor shipping destination. We make no representation as to the completeness, timeliness or other accuracy of any information on the Online Store or elsewhere on the Website and regardless of any efforts to avoid such inaccuracies, information on the Website may at times be incomplete, out of date and/or otherwise inaccurate, including, without limitation, with respect to product prices and/or availability of products on the Online Store. If any product purchased from the Website is not as described on the Website, your sole remedy is to return it to us in an unused condition. We are not responsible for, and will not honor, any price inaccuracies for, or other inaccuracies with respect to, any services or products offered for sale on the Website or any prices specified on any third party websites or elsewhere for any such services or products. In addition, we may make changes at any time to pricing and information regarding products and services, including, without limitation, with respect to availability and quantity limitations, as well as other information and content included on the Website at any time in our sole discretion without notice. While we may confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product. The shipment of the product to you constitutes our acceptance of an order. We may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.
4. Use of the Website; Website Material: The design of the Website and all materials, text, graphics, video, audio, information and other content displayed or otherwise used on or contained in, or that can be downloaded from, the Website (collectively, “Website Material”) are protected by copyright, trademark and other laws and may not be used except as permitted in these Terms and Conditions or with the prior written permission of the owner of such Website Material. You may not in any way modify, reproduce, publicly display, perform, distribute, create derivative works of, or otherwise use or exploit, in any form, manner or medium (whether now or hereafter existing), any Website Material, including, without limitation, for any public or commercial purpose.

All Submissions will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary (regardless of whether you may mark them as “confidential” or “proprietary” or otherwise). You hereby represent and warrant that your Submissions are original to you, do not infringe or otherwise violate any other person’s or entity’s intellectual property rights, are not obscene, vulgar, offensive, malicious, discriminatory, defamatory or otherwise unlawful, that no other person or entity has any rights thereto, and that any “moral rights” in your Submissions have been waived, and by providing any Submission to Hess Corporation or any of our affiliates or any of our respective employees or other representatives, regardless of the form, manner or medium that you make any such Submission (e.g., through the Website, including, without limitation, any other website or Facebook or any other social media accounts of, or by email, mail or any other manner to, Hess Corporation or any of its affiliates or otherwise), such Submission shall become the property of Hess Corporation upon receipt.
