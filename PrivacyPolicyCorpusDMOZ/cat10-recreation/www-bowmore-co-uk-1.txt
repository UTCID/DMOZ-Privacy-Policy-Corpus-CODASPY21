Islay Single Malt Whisky
We are the first licensed distillery on Islay and home to the oldest Scotch whisky maturation space in the world.
Within our No. 1 Vaults, you’ll find more Scotch history than anywhere else. It’s in the fresh sea air, the old stone walls, and the earth upon which every cask of Bowmore whisky matures.
A place of legend and craftsmanship, of beauty and reflection, the No. 1 Vaults is where Bowmore single malt Scotch whisky is meticulously matured until perfect. Our master distillers have been doing it that way since 1779.
