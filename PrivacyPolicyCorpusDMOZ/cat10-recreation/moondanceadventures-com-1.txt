Moondance Adventures Privacy PolicyAll information provided to Moondance Adventures will remain private. We will never sell or provide this information to any other companies.SEPTEMBER 30, 2018Our RelationshipWe’re in the kid business and our goal is to create trips of a lifetime. Here at Moondance, we strive to deliver amazing adventures, the opportunity to travel the world, and the chance to further develop one’s love for the outdoors. In doing so, we prepare well in advance for the success of our programs and an integral component of the preparation of our programs involves the collection and organization of data on Moondance applicants and their families. Obviously, the more we know about our students, the better we can customize and improve their experience. As we plan our programs, we will ask you for personal information (some mandatory, some optional); in turn, we will protect this information and ensure that it remains confidential. We also promise never to sell your information to anyone.What We Ask For & WhyYou can register for a Moondance program by enrolling online or by contacting our admissions team in the Moondance office. At that time, we will ask you to provide some basic information (such as your name, your child’s name/gender, their school, your phone number, medical information, credit card number and expiration date) so that we can identify you, follow up with you and process your application and/or enrollment. This information is then transferred to your Moondance trip leaders and guides, who will in turn make the appropriate adjustments and/or contact the various suppliers and facilities. In some instances, we may need additional information. Below is a description of some of the extra information we may require:Physical and Health DetailsWe need to obtain information about your child’s general health and health conditions as well as data like age, gender, and height so that we can provide him/her with the appropriate equipment and care. Medical forms with a physician’s signature and approval are required prior to your child’s summer program with forms to be submitted to the Moondance office.Flight and Passport InformationWe require your child’s flight information in order to orchestrate and organize airport retrieval and/or drop-off services with the Moondance leaders. For international trips, we request passport information because it is required by our administrative office and often local service providers.Dietary RequirementsWe understand that many people prefer or are required to follow certain diets. While many of our programs take place in a backcountry setting, we try to accommodate these choices and needs whenever possible. We recommend discussing any dietary requirements prior to enrolling so we can ensure your requirements can be met. To accomplish dietary accommodation, your dietary preferences and needs must be communicated with our office and recorded during our forms process.Personal PreferencesMoondance Adventures constantly strives to provide you and your family with the highest level of personal service. Our admissions team will record any special requests or preferences that are specified at the time of your application and/or enrollment. This information is passed on to your student’s leaders and enables the organization to meet and exceed all of your expectations. Also, our leaders may pass on information about special requests or preferences expressed by students while on a trip. We maintain a record of this information to ensure that on subsequent programs, these personal preferences continue to be accommodated. We also keep a record of past trips your child has taken with us, which allows us to understand the type of activities or trips your child prefers, leadership characteristics, and to determine what information (i.e. about new or revised programs) your family might find interesting.Our Email NewsletterMoondance Adventures e-mail newsletter provides regular updates and articles about Moondance trips, students, leaders, and other relevant information. To sign up for this service, we ask that you provide us with your name and your e-mail address.

We may disclose some of your personal information to those companies solely for the purpose of conducting research and analysis on behalf of Moondance Adventures. We use contractual and other means to protect your information while our agents are processing it. We are always interested in how our students and families first heard about Moondance, and we may ask you for information about how you discovered us and what types of media you watch and read. We gather this information to enable us to understand which marketing and advertising tools are most effective for our business.Website analyticsWe seek to improve our website and the online services we offer.
