On use that we have of this information is to determine your potential desire to receive communications about particular products or services.

Use of Cookies
We may use “cookies” to enhance your use of our Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by our web server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. When you return to our Site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on our Site.
Use of Web Beacons
Ocean Lakes pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. You may not decline web beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.
Security of the Personal Information
We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
When you make reservations or purchase tickets or other items online at the Ocean Lakes Site, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. We use a service company to process its credit card transactions and see www.authorize.net for its security policies.
Children
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Site. Below we explain how we do that for these “kids.” Also, when we use the term “parent” below, we mean to include legal guardians.
Kids can use the Ocean Lakes Site to view content and play games without any personal information being collected.
Internet Safety
The best way to know what kids are doing online is to ask. Asking questions helps inform you what your kid is doing on the Internet so that you can insure they are making safe choices. Important information to try to gather includes: (a) What sites are visited; (b) What activates are conducted at each site; (c) Why do you go to that site; (d) How much time is spent on each site; (e) Did the kid have to register to use the site (e.g. provide personal information); (e) What information was requested; and (f) What information was given.
Following are basic safety rules for kids. However, there is no substitute for proper parental supervision, education and communications.
(a) Never share User ID, User Names or passwords;
(b) Don’t reveal any personal identity information (e.g. don’t include your name in your user name);
(c) Never give any personal information about yourself or someone else when communicating online such as in blogs or chat rooms;
(d) Don’t share photos of yourself, your family, or your home with people you meet online;
(e) Delete emails from strangers without opening them;
(f) If you receive mean, disrespectful or threatening comments from online users, immediately log off and tell your parents;
(g) Understand that there is rarely anything on the Internet that is completely private;
(h) Never make plans to meet an online “friend” in person.
Changes to Privacy Statement
If we decide to materially change our Privacy Policies, we will post those changes through a prominent notice on the web site so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.
