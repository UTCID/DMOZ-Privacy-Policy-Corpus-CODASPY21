Privacy & Data Protection Policy
The RYA is
committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
The RYA needs to process certain personal data in order to do important stuff like manage your membership, run racing events and squads, take course and training bookings and issue and manage thousands of certificates and qualifications.
We do hold a lot of data and that's why we take your privacy very seriously.  We've made quite a few changes in advance of the GDPR coming into force and we hope these measures will help further protect your personal data that we hold.
If you have any questions, concerns or comments please email dpo@rya.org.uk (that's our Data Protection Officer)
There is now a lot of information about the specifics of what we do, how we do it and why - it was written by a lawyer which is why it's so long...
The important bits are linked with headings to help make it easier to find and digest.
But if you're not sure about anything just get in touch.
This policy explains when and why we collect personal information about you, how we use it, how we keep it secure and the circumstances when it may be disclosed to others. The policy also explains your rights in relation to that personal information.
We keep this policy under regular review, and may change it from time to time, so please check this page for any updates. The privacy policy was last updated on 05 February 2020.
