TESTIMONIALS >
“Just a note to thank you most sincerely for a wonderful trip. It will be a highlight of our lives. It was just magic to have everything done for us. The accommodation, the entertainment etc.etc. Don has sent his picture to half of N. Zealand. Went to the physio this morning and he has done his shoulder in and no more fishing till it settles.
He is still making excuses and singing like the inevitable Jack in the Box.
Hope your next trip is going well. Take care. We will always have fond memories. The invitation to visit us is sincere. Kind regards and many thanks for your wonderful organization.”
