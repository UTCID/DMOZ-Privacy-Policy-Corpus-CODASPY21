What Personal Data We Collect and Why We Collect It
1.1 Registration in our Community
When you register for an account in our community we ask you for a username, your email address, and a password. This information allows you to personalize your account preferences on the forum. We also ask subscribers to special publications for their emails in order to allow us to send them intended information from time to time. We will never sell or profit from your email beyond the intended purpose.
Member registration asks if you are at least 13 years of age. Our forum is based on an outdoor sport that attracts people of all ages. We do not allow a person to register unless they are at least 13 years of age. If at some point in time we or a staff member is made aware that a member had falsified their registration then the member in question may be asked to prove their age and thus their eligibility to be a member of this community.
If this becomes necessary the parents of said member will be involved and the information will only be reviewed to satisfy our requirements. A note will be made to verify that the member is in good standing or that their subscription has been canceled.
When a member cancels their account their personal information is removed from our database however the posts that they have made will continue to show their information and will remain in the forum.
1.2 Forms, Comments, Polls, Reviews
When you leave comments on the website we collect the data shown in the comments form, your IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment if you use the service.
When you fill out contact or other forms and input your information that information is retained for an appropriate amount of time to enable our staff to assist you with your question or comment and then deleted. If any part of the personal information is retained, express permission will be gained in advance.
Polls and reviews are available from time to time on our site both in the community and on the blog. If you chose to participate in a poll you are giving us your permission to retain the information provided in that poll indefinitely. The reviews and polls on our site are used to garner a greater understanding of our users so that we may provide services even better suited for our members.
Ultimate Bass sends out various newsletters and emails from time to time and to do this we use MailChimp and an opt-in list. You can find the MailChimp Privacy Policy here.

1.7 Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, ads, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
1.8 Analytics
Ultimate Bass uses Google Analytics to collect visitor information in order to make our site a better place to visit for the people who spend time here. Learn more about Google Analytics and privacy.

1.9 Google Ads
Google AdSense is a convenient way for Ultimate Bass to earn a few pennies while you visit. They provide us with an avenue to select ads that will show on our site that will interest our visitors. These are some of the ads that you see on our site. These ads use cookies to save a few things in cookies. Some of the things that they save is how many times you have seen a specific ad, or which site you were on when you clicked on that same ad. These things help Google to know what ad to show you, and what ad to show on our site. You can click here for the Google AdSense Privacy Policy.
1.10 Amazon Influencer Recommendation Ads
The Amazon affiliate program allows us to use our account on Amazon to recommend products to our users that we think they would use. We know that Amazon is one of the best places online to purchase fishing products and we trust that when you order something that you are getting a quality product. We love that with Amazon you can rely on their no hassle return policy and because of this we feel comfortable recommending products from their site to you. Click here for the Amazon Privacy Notice.
Who we share your data with
2.1 Akismet Anti-Spam
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service. Akismet Anti-Spam helps keep spam under control by filtering out spam comments–hundreds of millions, every day! Automattic provides the services for Akismet and their Privacy Notice is here.
2.2 MailChimp
We use MailChimp for our notification solution and thus we add your email to our list. We will not sell your email to any third party or send any notifications beyond that which are stated clearly in this privacy notice and your registration agreement.
Please contact us with any notification preferences you may have.
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
What rights you have over your data

Please contact us with your request about this.
