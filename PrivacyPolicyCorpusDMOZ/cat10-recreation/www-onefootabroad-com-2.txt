One Foot Abroad Terms and Conditions
Introduction
Our Terms and Conditions are designed to respond to the various scenarios that might occur before, during or after a trip. It helps us provide outstanding service by setting simple rules that will be fair to our clients and to our business.
The main points to note are:
We can organise almost any variation of a trip with our extensive database of accommodations, drivers and other service providers
We always provide the best available accommodation linked to the appropriate package
We will help you customise your holiday prior to making your reservation (after fees may apply)
If a change (e.g. change of date) is made by the Customer after the booking has been made, change fees will apply (see below)
If a problem occurs during your holiday (it rarely happens but just in case), we will do our utmost to solve it as quickly and as best we can. No refund higher than the price of the service in question can be asked of us.
In these Booking Conditions, the word “Company” means the entity who arranges your transport, accommodation, etc. and who offers it as a holiday. The “Company” Flexi Trip is part of One Foot Abroad Ltd registered in Ireland 460717.
“Consumer” means you, the person who buys or agrees to buy the holiday or any person on whose behalf you agree to purchase the holiday and who is listed on the Booking Form or any other person to whom you transfer a holiday which you have bought. The “Retailer” is the person who sells the holiday to you; he is not responsible for organising the accommodation or other component parts of this holiday.

The Contract
(a) A contract shall arise when the Company has received its completed Booking Form together with a deposit or full payment for the holiday and has issued written confirmation of its acceptance to the Retailer. The terms of contract are contained solely in this booking form, the Company’s confirmation, The Company’s Brochure or other descriptive material and the itinerary issued by The Company.
(b) The Company reserves the right to terminate the contract with the Consumer if the behaviour or conduct of the Consumer or any person listed on his/her Booking Form either prior to or during a holiday is likely to endanger the safety or  well-being of other Consumers in his/her company or that of the Consumer him/herself, or that of the Company’s representatives, contractors, agents or employees and the cancellation charges as provided for in Clause 3 of this Booking Form are payable by the Consumer, where as a result of the Consumer’s actions or this actions of any other person who is listed on his/her Booking Form, either or both of this following incidents occur:
(i) there is a delay or diversion to the means of transportation the subject of this contract;
(ii) the accommodation in which the Consumer is staying is damaged;
(iii)the Consumer hereby agrees to indemnify the Company against any claim (including legal cost) made against the Company in relation to the occurrence of such incidents.
Fitness and Disabled Persons
It is the Consumer’s responsibility to ensure that they have a level of fitness appropriate to complete the holiday safely. For that, The Company provides detailed information with regard to stage length, ascent and descent on each product’s website. This information is representative and is given in good faith. If the Consumer is unable to follow the route as designed and agreed between the quote and booking process, any change and / or extra cost incurred by the Consumer to complete daily stage will be the responsibility of the Consumer.
If the Consumer decides to make alternative arrangements than those booked with the Agency, the Agency should not be responsible for any cost and normal Cancellation / Change fees apply
It shall be the Consumer’s responsibility to disclose to The Company any physical or mental condition of a member of his/her party which may be relevant. The Company reserves the right to decline or provide a holiday for a disabled person where in the Company’s opinion that holiday would be inconsistent with the special needs of a disabled person.
Cancellation
To secure a holiday, the Consumer must pay a non-refundable deposit equal to 30% of the value of the land components of the holiday package for his/her party at the time of booking. NOTE: If flights are purchased by the Company on behalf of the Consumer, the cost of flight tickets are in addition to the deposit amount – with cancellation terms dictated by airline policies. The holiday must be paid for in full at least 60 days before the starting date of the holiday. If it is not paid by that date the Company shall have the option to cancel the holiday. If the Company exercises that option or if the Consumer cancels the holiday (which cancellation must be notified in writing to the Company) the following cancellation charges are payable by the Consumer:
Table of Cancellation Charges – The following charges which are expressed as a percentage of the holiday cost will be made:
* More than 60 days before the starting date of the holiday – the deposit ( + flight costs paid by the Company, where applicable).
* 8 days or more before the starting date of the holiday: 50% of the holiday cost ( + flight costs paid by the Company, where applicable).
* 7 days or less before the starting date of the holiday:   100% of holiday cost ( + flight costs paid by the Company, where applicable).
Two examples to explain the charges:
1)      A trip booked for May 8th has been fully paid at the cost of €100. The Consumer cancels the holiday on May 1st, i.e. 8 days or more before the start of the holiday. The consumer will receive a refund of 50% of the holiday cost (€50).
2)      A trip booked for May 8th has been fully paid at the cost of €100. The Consumer cancels the trip on May 2nd or on a later date, i.e. 7 days or less before the start of the holiday, there will be no refund. The Company retains 100% of the holiday cost.
3)      When travelling as part of a group; if six are travelling and one doesn’t pay the deposit this is still due as the booking was made initially on the original number of 6 people travelling.  If the person no longer travelling will not pay the deposit due this will be shared across the others travelling.  If a member of a group cancels, their non-refundable deposit is non-transferable to the cost of the rest of the trip for the group.
All cancellation charges apply to each person covered by any booking.

Holiday Participation
The Consumer agrees to accept the authority and decisions of the Company’s employees, representatives, tour leaders and agents whilst during the full duration of the holiday, starting on the first day and finishing on the last day of the holiday. If, in the opinion of such persons, the health, level of fitness or conduct of a Consumer at any time before or after departure appear likely to endanger the safe, comfortable or happy progress of a holiday, the Consumer may be excluded from all or part of the holiday without refund or recompense. In the case of ill-health the company may make such arrangements as it sees fit and recover the costs thereof from the client. If a Consumer commits an illegal act, the Consumer may be excluded from the holiday and the company shall cease to have responsibility to/for them. If you are affected by a condition, medical or otherwise, that might affect you or other people’s enjoyment or active participation of the tour, you must advise us at the time of booking. No refund will be given for any unused services.
Alteration by the Consumer
If after acceptance by the Company, a Consumer wishes to alter a holiday, the Company may at its discretion and if practicable facilitate the change. A request for alteration must be in writing and must be accompanied by a payment of €40 every time a change is made in the booking, which payment is not refundable. The new reservation date must be confirmed to the Company within 24h of the Consumer’s notification of change. This new reservation should be made for the same calendar year otherwise the cancellation policy applies.
No changes are permitted within 14 days of departure. For groups of 5 or more rooms no changes are permitted within 30 days of departure. (Cancellation fee applies)
If the alteration is impracticable the original holiday arrangement shall continue to apply. If only some of the Consumers booked request a change which is found to be practicable a price adjustment for all Consumers on the same booking may be payable and must be discharged on the date shown in the Company’s written confirmation of such change. If default is made by the Consumer in complying with the foregoing requirements the Company shall have the rights referred to in clause 3.

Online Accuracy and Consumer Information
We have taken great care to ensure that all the information contained on this website is accurate and correct. No details have been wilfully misrepresented and, whilst every effort has been made to be completely factual and accurate, there may be circumstances beyond our control where details have changed since our original descriptions were agreed. Much of the information is planned many months in advance; however, if at any stage we are informed of changes or alterations to properties. We will pass these changes to you, as soon as is practicable. Generic photographs contained on this website do not necessarily absolutely represent the particular accommodations, trail landscape or amenities linked to accommodation (or the actual hotel room, apartment, layout, decor, view etc. you might occupy or experience). They are however, absolutely representative of the general route chosen. Sometimes, especially in low season months, facilities in some properties or resorts may close down or operate at certain times only. Equally, repairs may need to be carried out or maintenance work becomes necessary. Such matters are wholly beyond the control of www.onefootabroad.com and no liability shall attach to us for any disappointment or diminution of enjoyment caused as a result.
Complaints
(a) Without prejudice to the Consumer’s rights to make a complaint in relation to a holiday, he/she must immediately inform the Company’s representative at the location where the Consumer is or by contacting the Dublin office on the telephone numbers or email addresses provided when the complaint arises and shall, if the Company requires it, complete a form setting out the detail of this Consumer’s complaint. If the Consumer fails to comply with such requirement, the Company shall be entitled to recover the cost from the Consumer of any additional expenses incurred by it in carrying out subsequent investigation of a complaint which is found to be unjustified.
(b) The Consumer shall be obliged to notify the Company in writing of any complaint not later than 28 days after his/her return to the port of departure or termination of the holiday whichever is the earlier. The Company can be contacted at:
One Foot Abroad, 34 Baggot Street Upper, Dublin 4, Ireland
Liability
The Company shall not be liable for any damage caused to the Consumer by the failure to perform the contract or the improper performance of the contract where the failure or the improper performance is due neither to any fault of the Company or Retailer acting on the Company’s behalf nor to that of another supplier of services:
(a) the failures which occur in the performance of the contract are attributable to the Consumer;
(b) such failures are attributable to any third parties unconnected with the provision of the services contracted for, with whom the Consumer makes individual direct arrangements whether as a result of the Company’s or its representative’s recommendation and are unforeseeable or unavoidable; or
(c) such failures are due to:
i) unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Retailer acting on his behalf or other supplier of services the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised; or
ii) an event which the Company, the Retailer acting on his behalf or the supplier of services, even with all due care could not foresee or forestall. In the case of damage other than death or personal injury or damage caused by defamation or by the wilful misconduct or gross negligence of the Company the amount of compensation which will be paid to the Consumer will be limited to, in the case of an adult an amount equal to double the inclusive price of the package to the adult concerned and in the case of a minor, an amount equal to the inclusive price of the package to this minor concerned. The Company’s liability will not exceed any limitation applicable under any international convention governing or relating to the provision of the service complained of in the place where they are performed or due to be performed even if that convention has not been ratified or applied in the Republic of Ireland.
(d) The customer must appreciate that in certain countries services in hotels, hostels and guest houses and in restaurants cannot be expected to be of the same standard as those in the Consumer’s country of origin and the term “reasonable standard” must be interpreted accordingly.
(e) We endeavour to make each holiday flawless. Our holidays are very complex and require the combination of numerous suppliers and services every day. On the rare occasion that a service included in a holiday purchased by the Consumer is not provided during the holiday, the Company will refund the usual cost of that service or the amount paid by the consumer for a replacement service of the same standard, on production of a receipt and within reason.
Arbitration
Any dispute or difference of any kind whatsoever which arises or occurs between any of the parties hereto in relation to anything or matter arising under, out of or in connection with this contract, shall be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators – Irish branch. If there is a dispute which cannot be mutually agreed, either party may apply directly to the Institute at 8 Merrion Square, Dublin 2, Ireland for the form Request for Appointment of Arbitrator. This form sets out the information to be submitted: names and addresses of the parties concerned, copies of the booking form and conditions (including the arbitration clause), details of any legal or other people who are to represent the parties in the arbitration and an administration fee of €50 (an administration fee of €127 is payable in respect of Personal Injuries claims in excess of €9,523).
