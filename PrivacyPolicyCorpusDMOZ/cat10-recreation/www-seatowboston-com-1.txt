Our Team
Capt. Steve Winkler - Co-Owner/Senior Captain
Steve Winkler is the Senior Captain and Franchise Co-Owner of Sea Tow Boston. With over 40 years experience, as a marine professional, in the Boston area, Steve is uniquely suited to perform his duties at Sea Tow Boston.
Capt. Steve is a U.S. Coast Guard Licensed Merchant Mariner. Originally licensed in 1967 with an OUPV (Six Pack), he currently holds a 100 Ton Master Near Coastal of Auxiliary Sail with Commercial Assistance Towing and Radar Observer Unlimited endorsements. He is a PADI certified SCUBA diver, a certified Oil Spill responder, a OMC certified outboard mechanic and a Sea Tow certified Salvage Master. Winkler primarily oversees the day to day administration of the Sea Tow Franchise along with the training and certification of all the Sea Tow Boston Captains. Although quite a bit of his time is spent behind the scenes, Capt. Steve makes the time to routinely get underway and assist disabled boaters. Each year Capt. Steve will normally get underway for and assist about 200 disabled boaters.
"Frankly, I just really enjoy being on the water and assisting people," he says, "it's the reason I got into Sea Tow in the first place." Winkler also Lectures on the Assistance Towing Industry and the Sea Tow Membership program whenever he gets a chance. If you have a marine related group that need a speaker or if your yacht club or marina is thinking about starting a Sea Tow "Group Membership" plan just contact Sea Tow Boston for Steve's availability.
Capt. Dave Winkler - Co-Owner/Senior Captain
Dave Winkler is a Senior Captain and Franchise Co-Owner of Sea Tow Boston. With over 30 years experience, as a marine professional, in the Boston area, Dave is uniquely suited to perform his duties at Sea Tow Boston.
Dave is a U.S. Coast Guard Licensed Merchant Mariner. He currently hold a 100 Ton Master Near Coastal of Auxiliary Sail with Commercial Assistance Towing and Radar Observer Unlimited endorsements. He is a PADI certified SCUBA diver, a certified Oil Spill responder, a OMC certified outboard mechanic and a Sea Tow certified Salvage Master. Captain Dave primarily oversees the Membership program administration duties for the Sea Tow Boston Franchise along with assisting in the ongoing training and certification of Sea Tow Boston Captains. He also enjoys working in the Communications Dispatch Center on busy weekends.
"As a Licensed Captain that actually works the Boston area, I feel I bring a unique perspective to the job of Dispatcher;" Dave says. "It's a great feeling to be able to visualize the problem a member is having, talk them through it and get them back underway." Dave's ability to visualize a problem and assist a boater over the radio has saved quite a few members a long tow. "That's what Sea Tow is about..." Dave continues, "assisting members, any way we can. It's not just about towing!" Dave is also a life-long sailor. He currently ownes a Star Class One-Design sailboat and a Catalina 30 sloop. Unfortunately, being a Sea Tow Captain doesn't leave him much time to sail in the summer. You can usually catch him out there on Wednesday nights, however, for the PHRF or local fleet races.
Capt. Steve Winkler Jr. - Captain
As a native of Winthrop, Massachusetts, and growing up in a professional boating family, Captain Steve Winkler Jr. can't remember a time that he wasn't on the water.
By age nine, Steve Winkler had already spent years gaining experience with his dad aboard a variety of sail and power vessels when he took the helm of "Wanderer" the first boat of his own. Every day that summer was spent at the Cottage Park Yacht Club, junior sailing program in Winthrop, racing and sailing his new N-10 class boat. Other boats, power and sail, followed through the years along with occasional part time after school work in the family owned boat yard and marine store. All of it furthering his knowledge of recreational boating.
A four year stint in the U.S. Navy as a damage control Petty Officer and firefighting team leader furthered his knowledge. While assigned to the USS John F. Kennedy, Steve was routinely assigned to the damage control center located at the heart of the ship. At DC Central he was a watch officer responsible for all the firefighting and security watchstanders as well as every firefighting and damage control system on the ship. As a damage control team leader Petty Officer Winkler routinely led other sailors into the bowels of the ship looking for problems both in training exercises and for real. He was trained in the use of sophisticated firefighting and damage control equipment such as thermal imaging systems, Oxygen cutting slice packs, dewatering and fire pumps as well as damage control, shoring and firefighting techniques.
Capt. Ken Webber - Captain
Captain Ken joined the Sea Tow team in May of 2004 as a part time seasonal captain. He works primarily out of the Sea Tow Boston Base servicing Sea Tow members and other boaters in the greater Boston Harbor area. Ken started his boating experience with his dad around the time he was 8 years old out of the Saugus river (S.R.Y.C.) in Lynn. He learning to operate, navigate and work on his dad's various wood boats ranging from 16 to 28 feet over the years.
As soon as he could he joined the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary to further his education in boating skills and navigation. Capt. Ken Webber has been a proud member of the USCGA for over 33 years. In the Auxiliary he has held positions such as Communications Officer, Operations Officer and was elected Flotilla Commander. He is a qualified coxswain and vessel safety examiner. He has been trained in many aspects of the auxiliary, including Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, Helo OPS and night operations.
He also holds a level 1 and level 3 certificate in shipboard firefighting. That training was conducted with (MIRT) Marine Incidence Response Team and taught by the Delaware River & Bay Marine Firefighting Task Force. Capt. Ken Webber is a U.S. Coast Guard Merchant Marine Officer. He currently holds a 100 Ton Master Near Coastal license with a Commercial Assistance Towing endorsement. He has used his license over the years to delivered boats, up to 70 feet, to various ports from Florida to Gloucester. He is also a PADI certified scuba diver. On any summer weekend if Capt. Ken is not on a Sea Tow boat you will most likely see him enjoying some time with his wife Kathy on their personal vessel Sea Kindly. Give him a wave when you see him.
Reliant - 21' Proline
Sea Tow RELIANT is a 21' Proline Commercial Assistance Fast Response Towing & Salvage Vessel.
She is ACAPT certified and inspected by C-PORT, the assistance towing industry association of record, to perform Coastal Assistance Towing.
The RELIANT was purpose built by Sea Tow Boston in 2007 specifically to have an "Air Draft" of less than 6 feet. With its custom folding mast, RELIANT is able to navigate the North Station rail road bridge on the Charles River when the bridge is in the closed position. The RR bridge closes twice a day for approximately 2 hours each time for rush hour train traffic. Sea Tow Boston required a vessel that could navigate the bridge in order to service our members using the Charles River 24 hours a day without delay.
The "RELIANT" is also large enough, powerful enough and so well equipped that it is a primary workhorse in the Sea Tow Boston fleet. She is a favorite of the Sea Tow Captains because she is extremely fast and nimble. RELIANT does everything a Fast Response Towboat should do and does it well.
Rescue 1 - 28' Mako
Our largest towboat and primary offshore vessel is "RESCUE 1" a 284 Mako Commercial Assistance Fast Response Towing & Salvage Vessel.
With her 300 gallon fuel capacity, enclosed heated cabin, deep vee hull and powerful fuel efficient engines, "RESCUE 1" is perfectly suited for long offshore tows. Yet at only 33 plus feet in overall length she is still very maneuverable and small enough to "Hip Tow" disabled vessels into the tightest Marinas and Yacht Clubs in the area.
"RESCUE 1" joined the Sea Tow Boston fleet in spring of 2000 and has proved to be a welcome addition
Rescue 2 - 26' Twin Vee
Sea Tow RESCUE 2 is a 26' Twin-Vee Commercial Assistance Fast Response Towing & Salvage Vessel.
She is ACAPT certified and inspected by C-PORT, the assistance towing industry association of record, to perform Coastal Assistance Towing.
The RESCUE 2 was custom built by Sea Tow Boston in 2008 to meet the specific needs of an Assistance Towing Vessel in the waters of Boston Harbor. The twin hull catamaran design allows a very stable, fast and smooth ride through the close chop and confused waters often found in the Boston area. The RESCUE 2 was also designed to carry an astonishing amount of equipment in it's jumbo pilot house.
Sea Tow captains often are on patrol and responding to cases for 8-10 hours at a time on a busy summer day. Functionality of the onboard systems and crew comfort were major concerns when designing the captains work station in the pilot house. All the equipment: VHF radios, digital direction finders, chart plotters, radar, depth sounders, cell phones, loud hailers as well as the switches for the various lights that the captain must operate while underway were custom placed in the pilot house to make his job safer, easier and more efficient.
In fact a "state-of-the-art" communication headset with a noise canceling mic was installed to minimize the ambient noise level on the RESCUE 2. This Piratecom system integrates both VHF radios, the stereo, and the cell phone into one headset and a high quality microphone. It reduces the ambient noise level by about 90% and severely reduces operator fatigue, while still allowing him to clearly hear and use his communication equipment.
The RESCUE 2 and it's sister boats RESCUE 3 and RESPONDER have allowed Sea Tow Boston Captains to service Sea Tow Members quickly, efficiently and safely in modern purpose built vessels.
Rescue 3 - 26' Twin Vee
Sea Tow "RESCUE 3" is a model year 2004, 26' Power Cat Commercial Assistance Fast Response Towing & Salvage Vessel. The towboat, made by Twin-Vee, has a catamaran hull providing a very smooth ride in the close chop of Salem Sound. With its center console, twin hulls and open deck space the vessel provides an extremely stable work platform. The large, easily accessible center console is great for storing the pumps and salvage gear she carries. The "RESCUE 3" is a great general purpose towboat in the Sea Tow Boston Fleet. She consistently logs hundreds of underway hours annually assisting Sea Tow Members. This Power Cat style towboat, with its high speed, soft ride and sea keeping abilities is a favorite amoung assistance towing professionals. The "RESCUE 3" joined the Sea Tow Boston fleet in June of 2004 as the business expanded. She is the first in a series custom built towboats in Sea Tow Boston's expanding fleet. "RESCUE 3" is equiped with state of the art electronics and a pair of very environmentally friendly, ultra low emmission, Johnson 4 stroke engines.
Responder - 26' Twin Vee
Sea Tow RESPONDER is a 26' Twin-Vee Commercial Assistance Fast Response Towing & Salvage Vessel.  She is ACAPT certified and inspected by C-PORT, the assistance towing industry association of record, to perform Coastal Assistance Towing. The RESPONDER was custom built by Sea Tow Boston in 2006 to meet the specific needs of an Assistance Towing Vessel in the waters of Boston Harbor. The twin hull catamaran design allows a very stable, fast and smooth ride through the close chop and confused waters often found in the Boston area.
The RESPONDER was also designed to carry an astonishing amount of equipment in it's jumbo pilot house. (see the list below) Sea Tow captains often are on patrol and responding to cases for 8-10 hours at a time on a busy summer day. Functionality of the onboard systems and crew comfort were major concerns when designing the captains work station in the pilot house.
All the equipment: VHF radios, digital direction finders, chart plotters, radar, depth sounders, cell phones, loud hailers as well as the switches for the various lights that the captain must operate while underway were custom placed in the pilot house to make his job safer, easier and more efficient. In fact a "state-of-the-art" communication headset with a noise canceling mic was installed to minimize the ambient noise level on the RESPONDER. This Piratecom system integrates both VHF radios, the stereo, and the cell phone into one headset and a high quality microphone. It reduces the ambient noise level by about 90% and severely reduces operator fatigue, while still allowing him to clearly hear and use his communication equipment. The RESPONDER and it's sister boats RESCUE 2 and RESCUE 3 have allowed Sea Tow Boston Captains to service Sea Tow Members quickly, efficiently and safely in modern purpose built vessels.
