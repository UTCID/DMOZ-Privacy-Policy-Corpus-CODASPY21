6.2
We supply Products for your domestic and private use. You agree not to use products for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose, and we shall have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity if you use such Products otherwise than in accordance with these terms.
International Customers
Please note that We only sell to customers in the UK.  We do not accept orders from, or deliver to, customers outside the UK.
Products, Pricing and Availability
We make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all descriptions and graphical representations of Products available from Us correspond to the actual Products.  Please note, however, the following:
Images of Products are for illustrative purposes only.  There may be slight variations in colour between the image of a product and the actual product sold due to differences in computer displays and lighting conditions;
Images and/or descriptions of packaging are for illustrative purposes only, the actual packaging of Products may vary
Please note that sub-Clause 8.1 does not exclude Our responsibility for mistakes due to negligence on Our part and refers only to minor variations of the correct Products, not to different Products altogether.  Please refer to Clause 12 if you receive incorrect Products (i.e. Products that are not as described).
Where appropriate, you may be required to select the required size, model, colour, number of the Products that you are purchasing.
We cannot guarantee that Products will always be available. If the Products are unavailable for your order for more than 2 business days, we will e-mail you. If Products are unobtainable we will notify you.
Minor changes may, from time to time, be made to certain Products between your Order being placed and Us processing that Order and dispatching the Products, for example, to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, or to address particular technical or security issues.  Any such changes will not change any main characteristics of the Products and will not normally affect your use of those Products. However, if any change is made that would affect your use of the Products, suitable information will be provided to you.
We make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all prices shown on Our Site are correct at the time of going online.  We reserve the right to change prices and to add, alter, or remove special offers from time to time and as necessary.  All pricing information is routinely reviewed and updated annually. Changes in price will not affect any order that you have already placed (please note sub-Clause 8.9 regarding VAT, however).
All prices are checked by Us before We accept your Order. In the unlikely event that We have shown incorrect pricing information, We will contact you in writing to inform you of the mistake.  If the correct price is lower than that shown when you made your Order, we will simply charge you the lower amount and continue processing your Order. If the correct price is higher, We will give you the option to purchase the Products at the correct price or to cancel your Order (or the affected part of it).  We will not proceed with processing your Order in this case until you respond. If We do not receive a response from you within 2 business days, We will treat your Order as cancelled and notify you of this in writing.
In the event that the price of Products you have ordered changes between your Order being placed and Us processing that Order and taking payment, you will be charged the price shown on Our Site at the time of placing your Order.
All prices on Our Site include VAT.  If the VAT rate changes between your Order being placed and Us taking payment, the amount of VAT payable will be automatically adjusted when taking payment.
Delivery charges are not included in the price of Products displayed on Our Site. Standard delivery charges will be presented to you as part of the order process.
Orders – How Contracts Are Formed
Our Site will guide you through the ordering process.  Before submitting your Order you will be given the opportunity to review your Order and amend it.  Please ensure that you have checked your Order carefully before submitting it.
If, during the order process, you provide Us with incorrect or incomplete information, please contact Us as soon as possible.  If We are unable to process your Order due to incorrect or incomplete information, We will contact you to ask to correct it. If you do not give us the accurate or complete information within a reasonable time of Our request, We will cancel your Order and treat the Contract as being at an end.  If We incur any costs as a result of your incorrect or incomplete information, We may pass those costs on to you.
No part of Our Site constitutes a contractual offer capable of acceptance.  Your Order constitutes a contractual offer that We may, at Our sole discretion, accept.  Our acknowledgement of receipt of your Order does not mean that we have accepted it. Our acceptance is indicated by Us sending you an Order Confirmation by email.  Only once We have sent you an Order Confirmation will there be a legally binding Contract between Us and you.
A health questionnaire must be completed and submitted as part of the ordering process, AND approved by Us before the sale of any medicines
Order Confirmations shall contain the following information:
Your Order Number;
Confirmation of the Products ordered including full details of the main characteristics of those Products;
Fully itemised pricing for the Products ordered including, where appropriate, taxes, delivery and other additional charges;
Estimated delivery date(s);
We will also include a paper copy of the Order Confirmation with your Products.
In the unlikely event that We do not accept or cannot fulfil your Order for any reason, We will explain why in writing.  No payment will be taken under normal circumstances. If We have taken payment any such sums will be refunded to you as soon as possible and in any event within 14 days
Any refunds due under this Clause 9 will be made using the same payment method that you used when ordering the Products.
Payment
Payment for Products and related delivery charges must always be made in advance and you will be prompted to pay during the order process.  All items remain the property Fleet Street Clinic until final payment of all sums owing.
We accept the following methods of payment on Our Site:
debit or credit card;
Delivery, Risk and Ownership
All Products purchased through Our Site will normally be delivered within 3 to 5 business days after the date of Our Order Confirmation unless otherwise agreed or specified during the Order process (subject to delays caused by events outside of Our control, for which see Clause 14).
cannot be held responsible for any non-delivery caused by courier or postal services
In the unlikely event that We fail to deliver the Products within 3 to 5 business days of Our Order Confirmation (or as otherwise agreed or specified as under sub-Clause 11.1), if any of the following apply you may treat the Contract as being at an end immediately:
We have refused to deliver your Products; or
In light of all relevant circumstances, delivery within that time period was essential; or
You told Us when ordering the Products that delivery within that time period was essential.
If you do not wish to cancel under sub-Clause 11.3 or if none of the specified circumstances apply, you may specify a new (reasonable) delivery date.  If We fail to meet the new deadline, you may then treat the Contract as being at an end.
You may cancel all or part of your Order under sub-Clauses 11.3 or 11.4 provided that separating the Products in your Order would not significantly reduce their value.  Any sums that you have already paid for cancelled Products and their delivery will be refunded to you within 14 days. Please note that if any cancelled Products are delivered to you, you must return them to Us or arrange with Us for their collection.  In either case, We will bear the cost of returning the cancelled Products.
Delivery shall be deemed complete and the responsibility for the Products will pass to you once We have delivered the Products to the address you have provided.
Ownership of the Products passes to you once we have received payment in full of all sums due (including any applicable delivery charges).
Any refunds due under this Clause 11 will be made using the same payment method that you used when ordering the Products.

Please note that you will not be eligible to claim under this Clause 12 if We informed you of the fault(s), damage or other problems with the Products before you purchased them (and it is because of the same issue that you now wish to return them); if you have purchased the Products for an unsuitable purpose that is neither obvious nor made known to Us and the problem has resulted from your use of the Products for that purpose; or if the problem is the result of normal wear and tear, misuse or intentional or careless damage.  Please also note that you may not return Products to Us under this Clause 12 merely because you have changed your mind, as our medical products are prescribed to you personally.
To return Products to Us for any reason under this Clause 12, please contact us at shop@fleetstreetclinic.com. We will be fully responsible for the costs of returning Products via standard postage under this Clause 12 and will reimburse you where appropriate.

Refunds under this Clause 12 will be made using the same payment method that you used when ordering the Products.
