Educational, nationality and professional background information;
Usernames and passwords;

Sensitive personal data
If collecting or storing sensitive personal data such as information relating to health, beliefs or political affiliation, we typically ask for your explicit consent. However, there are some situations where it will not be possible to request consent, such as if you have an accident at one of our events. If this does occur, we will ensure your privacy rights are protected.
Children’s personal data
Our services and products are directed to academics and business professionals. They are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data from this age group. If any information is collected from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, it will be deleted.
How and why personal information is used
This section explains in detail how and why we use personal information.
Lawful Processing in Europe
Informa Engage  collects and uses personal information. The lawful bases we use for this activity in Europe, as required under European data protection laws, are:
Where it is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you
Where we have a legitimateinterest to do so, provided your rights do not override theseinterests
Where you have consented to its use
Where our colleagues believe it is in your vital interests to share your personal details, for example with emergency services
Where required to comply with our legal obligation
Product enquiries, sales and administration
As part of a purchase, product enquiry, request for information and for account administration, we collect information such as your name, country, job title, company information or academic affiliation, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number.
If you have made an enquiry about us or our products or services, either online or over the phone, we will use your personal information to respond to the enquiry or to take other steps at your request, before you enter into a contract. For example, we collect the e-mail addresses and additional contact details of those who send e-mails to request information. Where a sales representative speaks to you over the phone, the calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes only.
If you have registered for or purchased a product or services, including on a trial basis, your personal information will be used to provide that product or service, communicate about it and handle payments, as is necessary for the performance of the contract entered into with us.
For purchases, payment information, including credit/debit card number/bank details and billing addresses are also collected.Where payment card processors are used to facilitate payment card transactions on our websites, your data will be collected and used according to that data processors’ privacy policy.
If your personal information is relevant to certain products and is freely available through public sources, such as on a website related to your work or profession, we may use this personal information for providing customers with our products, as is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation.
Marketing
We will use your personal information to send you newsletters, offers or other marketing emails that keep you up to date with news, events, products and research opportunities, from Informa Engage and other companies that may be of interest. Depending on the nature of your interaction with us and the laws of the country where you live, you may have actively given us your consent for this, by opting in, or we may be entitled to rely on your implied consent or our legitimate interests. The opportunity to opt out of future marketing emails will always be provided, and information on how to do this given when your personal information is collected and on every marketing email sent.
Sponsors and Gated Resources
From time to time Informa Engage sponsors wish to contact our subscribers and customers who have indicated an interest in their products, services or events. If you register for or access services offered by these sponsors, you choose to share your name and contact details directly with those sponsors so that they may contact you. For example, if you register for a sponsor-branded (or co-branded with us) resource, we will collect your registration information on behalf of that sponsor for its own use. We may also keep a copy of that data for our own use, consistent with this privacy policy. We may provide a link to the sponsor’s privacy policy as well as to this policy on the registration page.
Similarly, if you access third-party resources in certain registration-only, or “gated”websites, resource centers, or directory services on our websites, we may share your registration information when you access or click on a link to technical resources provided or sponsored by another company. This includes third-party resources sold through our online stores. In addition, we may share your contact information with sponsors of a particular e-newsletter if you click on their information. If you do not wish to have your information shared, the opportunity to opt-out is provided in the e-newsletter.
When you register for an in-person or digital event, your registration information is provided to the sponsor(s) of such event. This information may also be provided to sponsors of special sessions within the larger event.
If you want to know how a sponsor or advertiser will use your data, please review their particular privacy policy. As noted above, your registration for and log-on to any of the above services constitutes your consent to be contacted by any sponsors selected. The sponsor’s or advertiser’s privacy policies explain their use of your information.
Customer and Prospects Management including Analytics
We may use your personal information, combined with publicly available data and demographic data,to maintain our customer database and carry out internal analysis of the usage of our products and services. This is done to improve those services, develop new products and predict future customer behavior, as part of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. This may include automated profiling and campaign management techniques.
Mobile Applications and Websites Analytics including Location Data
We may combine visitor session information, or other information collected through tracking technologies, with personally identifiable information in order to understand and measure your online experience and determine what products, promotions and services are likely to be of interest.
Technical methods are also used in HTML e-mails sent to visitors, for purposes including: (i) to determine whether visitors have opened or forwarded e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails, (ii) to customise the display of banner advertisements and other messages after closing an e-mail, and (iii) to determine whether a visitor has made an enquiry or a purchase in response to a particular e-mail.

Online membership communities
You may choose to participate in online membership communities on our sites that allow you to create and publish a profile and other personal information. These communities may provide privacy controls that allow choice in how much of your profile and other information to make public or to share with others within the community.
Privacy controls are usually found on the page on which you edit your profile, and each individual is responsible for understanding how those controls work, including default settings, and choosing how the information provided is shared and protected.  By participating in these online membership communities you may be contacted by other participants using the information provided.
When you disclose personal information on any public community boards or chat areas of this website, or any other website used as a result of use of this website, such personal information can be collected and used by anyone who views that board or area. This may result in unsolicited messages from other participants or other parties, outside of our control or responsibility.
Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling
We use algorithm-based technologies to personalise dynamic web content based on your explicit and/or implicit interests. We carry out general profiling such as segmentation, non-automated and automated decision-making based on profiling for the purpose of providing you with a more relevant experience and for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. Automated decision making is never used in any way that produces a legal or similarly significant effect.
Depending on the laws of the country where you live, you may have rights related to our decision.  For example, if you live in the European Union, you may have the right not to be subject to our decision, or you may have the right to insist on human intervention in the process, express your point of view or contest the decision. To exercise any such right, please contact us via one of the methods set out in the “Contact Us” section below. In some cases, we may have the right to continue with our decision, in accordance with applicable laws. This will be explained if it is the case. Otherwise, we will respond to your request as promptly as reasonably possible.
Compliance with our legal obligations
To ensure compliance with international trade sanction laws and regulations, we screen customers, vendors and suppliers against US, OFAC, BIS, UN, EU and UK sanctions lists. Should any screening check flag an issue where we cannot continue in a contract with a customer or supplier, they will always be informed.
How we protect personal information
Any personal information given to us will be treated with the utmost care and security.This section sets out some of the security measures in place.
A variety of physical and technical measures is used to keep data safe and prevent unauthorised access to, or use or disclosure of personal information.
Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems and we control who has access to information, using both physical and electronic means. Our colleagues receive data protection training, and we have detailed security and data protection policies that colleagues are required to follow when handling personal data.
All reasonable steps are taken to ensure that your personal information is kept secure from unauthorised access, but we cannot guarantee it will be secure during the transmission process to this website because this transmission is not controlled by us. We make use of HTTPS (HTTP Secure) whereby the communication protocol is encrypted via Transport Layer Security for secure communication over a computer network. The website is loaded via HTTPS, represented by the lock icon in your web browser, which ensures the transmission is secure and is demonstrated by a certificate issued by an official security certificate authority to us.
International transfer of personal information
As an international business and because of the technologies we use, personal information may be accessed by our colleagues and third-party service providers from locations outside of the European Economic Area, whose data protection laws may not be as extensive as those in Europe.
To ensure the same level of protection is in place when processing is conducted outside the European Economic Area, we use appropriate safeguards approved by the European Commission.
We apply appropriate protection to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected and is treated in line with this Policy. Informa Engage has put in place international data transfer agreements between its companies and with relevant third-party service providers based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.
