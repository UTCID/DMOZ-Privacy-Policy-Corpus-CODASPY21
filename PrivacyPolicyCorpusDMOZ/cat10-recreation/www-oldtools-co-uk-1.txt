The size of our network and widening acceptance of our product have helped us become one of the leading payment networks for online auction websites. PayPal is also being increasingly used on other ecommerce sites for the sale of goods such as electronics and household items, the sale of services such as web design and travel, and the sale of digital content. Offline businesses, including lawyers, contractors and doctors, have increasingly begun to receive payments online through PayPal. PayPal's service, which lets users send payments for free, can be used from computers or web-enabled mobile phones.
PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. is duly licenced as a Luxembourg credit institution in the sense of Article 2 of the law of 5 April 1993 on the financial sector as amended and is under the prudential supervision of the Luxembourg supervisory authority, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, with registered office in L-1150 Luxembourg.”
