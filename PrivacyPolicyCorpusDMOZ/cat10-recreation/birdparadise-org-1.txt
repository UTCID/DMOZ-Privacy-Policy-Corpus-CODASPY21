PRIVACY POLICY for
http://birdparadise.org
Last Updated: November 30, 2015
http://birdparadise.org strives to
offer its visitors the many advantages
of Internet
technology and to provide an
interactive and personalized
experience. We may use Personally
Identifiable
Information (your name, e-mail address,
street address, telephone number)
subject to the terms of this privacy
policy. We will never sell, barter, or
rent your email address to any
unauthorized third party. Period."
How we gather information from users
How we collect and store information
depends on the page you are visiting,
the activities in which you elect
to participate and the services
provided. For example, you may be asked
to provide information when you
register
for access to certain portions of our
site or request certain features, such
as newsletters or when you make a
purchase. You may provide information
when you participate in sweepstakes and
contests, message boards and chat
rooms, and other interactive areas of
our site. Like most Web sites,
http://birdparadise.org also
collects information automatically and
through the use of electronic tools
that may be transparent to our
visitors. For example, we may log the
name of your Internet Service Provider
or use cookie technology to
recognize you and hold information from
your visit. Among other things, the
cookie may store your user name and
password, sparing you from having to
re-enter that information each time you
visit, or may control the number of
times you encounter a particular
advertisement while visiting our site.
As we adopt additional technology, we
may also gather information through
other means. In certain cases, you can
choose not to provide us with
information, for example by setting
your browser to refuse to accept
cookies, but if you do you may be
unable to
access certain portions of the site or
may be asked to re-enter your user name
and password, and we may not be
able to customize the site’s features
according to your preferences.
What we do with the information we
collect
Like other Web publishers, we collect
information to enhance your visit and
deliver more individualized
content and advertising. We respect
your privacy and do not share your
information with anyone.
Aggregated Information (information
that does not personally identify you)
may be used in many ways. For
example, we may combine information
about your usage patterns with similar
information obtained from other users
to help enhance our site and services
(e.g., to learn which pages are visited
most or what features are most
attractive). Aggregated Information may
occasionally be shared with our
advertisers and business partners.
Again, this information does not
include any Personally Identifiable
Information about you or allow anyone
to
identify you individually.
We may use Personally Identifiable
Information collected on
http://birdparadise.org to
communicate with you about your
registration and customization
preferences; our Terms of Service and
privacy
policy; services and products offered
by http://birdparadise.org. and other
topics we think you
might find of interest.
Personally Identifiable Information
collected by http://birdparadise.org
may also be used
for other purposes, including but not
limited to site administration,
troubleshooting, processing of e-
commerce
transactions, administration of
sweepstakes and contests, and other
communications with you. Certain third
parties who provide technical support
for the operation of our site (our Web
hosting service for example) may
access such information. We will use
your information only as permitted by
law. In addition, from time to time
as we continue to develop our business,
we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
other companies or businesses.
In such transactions, user information
may be among the transferred assets. We
may also disclose your
information in response to a court
order, at other times when we believe
we are reasonably required to do so by
law, in connection with the collection
of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to
law enforcement authorities
whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not
provide you with notice prior to
disclosure
in such cases.
Affiliated sites, linked sites and
advertisements
http://birdparadise.org expects its
partners, advertisers and affiliates to
respect the
privacy of our users. Be aware,
however, that third parties, including

created or hosted by a third party.
Also, through

responsible for the
actions or policies of such third
parties. You should check the
applicable privacy policies of those
third
parties when providing information on a
feature or page operated by a third
party.
While on our site, our advertisers,
promotional partners or other third
parties may use cookies or other
technology to attempt to identify some
of your preferences or retrieve
information about you. For example,
some
of our advertising is served by third
parties and may include cookies that
enable the advertiser to determine
whether you have seen a particular
advertisement before. Other features
available on our site may offer
services
operated by third parties and may use
cookies or other technology to gather
information.
http://birdparadise.org does not
control the use of this technology by
third parties or the
resulting information, and is not
responsible for any actions or policies
of such third parties.
You should also be aware that if you
voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message
boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and
can be collected and used by third
parties
without our knowledge and may result in
unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such
activities are beyond the control of
http://birdparadise.org and this
policy.

that applied at the time the
