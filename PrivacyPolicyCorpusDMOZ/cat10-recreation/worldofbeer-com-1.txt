Privacy Policy
Effective Date: May 19, 2017
World of Beer Franchising, Inc. (“WOB,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) takes seriously the confidentiality of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the information collected through this web site and the mobile applications that we provide (together, “Site”) and how that information is used and shared. WOB and its suppliers may collect or receive the types of information described below in connection with your access to and use of the Site (together, “Collected Information”).
BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE, OR BY ACCEPTING OUR WOB REWARDS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THAT YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION AS DISCUSSED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SITE.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made a part of our Terms of Use, our WOB Rewards Terms and Conditions, and any end user license or similar agreement pertaining to any mobile application that WOB provides. We may modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time, which changes will be effective immediately upon their posting on the Site. Material changes will be posted conspicuously on the Site.
Non-U.S. Users
If you are visiting the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that Collected Information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the United States (where our and our suppliers’ servers and databases are located and operated). The data protection and related laws and regulations of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in the country from which you are accessing the Site. If you do not consent to this transfer, do not accept this privacy policy or otherwise use the website.
Ownership & Business Transactions
WOB is the exclusive owner of all Collected Information. In the event of a change in control or reorganization of WOB or sale by WOB of substantially all of its assets, Collected Information may be transferred or sold to such WOB successor. That successor will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy as it applies to that Collected Information.
We Collect Personally Identifiable Information and Other Information that You Submit
Personally Identifiable Information
You may visit the Site without disclosing any personally identifiable information, but you will be required to provide personally identifiable information in order to use certain Site features, such as requesting to receive our email newsletter, registering with the Site to receive email notifications for WOB locations, purchasing a gift card, requesting to receive more information about franchising opportunities, or joining the WOB rewards program.
WOB will collect any personally identifiable information from or about you that you provide to us, which information may include your name, contact information (including your telephone number, physical address, and email address), shipping information, payment information, and your birthdate. You may choose to submit additional information, which we will collect if you choose to provide it. If you provide your wireless or other telephone number to us, we will use that telephone number to look up your WOB rewards account, if applicable. We will use your personally identifiable information to communicate with you and as otherwise set forth below, subject to applicable laws.
Mailing List Information
If you sign up or otherwise opt in to receive emailed promotions from us, you will need to submit your name, email address, and birthdate. You must be at least 21 years of age in order to sign up for our mailing lists. We will use this information to provide you with promotional and other communications that we think may be of interest to you.

If you sign up for the WOB rewards program you will need to submit your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, and birthdate. To register your physical WOB rewards program card on the Site, you will need to enter the loyalty card number located on that card.

We will use this data to improve this web site’s structure and content. Google may use this data in accordance with its Privacy Policy, which is located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy.

Cookies
This web site uses cookies to track the use of this web site and to facilitate and enhance your experience on this web site. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. This web site may use both cookies that we implement and cookies implemented by our suppliers and other third parties. Cookies enable us to track how you access and use this web site, to learn when and how you and others visit this web site, to learn which pages of this web site are popular and which are not, and to learn which web sites direct you to this web site.

Please be aware that disabling this function may impact your use and enjoyment of this web site. Our web site suppliers may use cookies and other tracking technologies to track visitors across the Internet to understand how you get to this web site. Due to this automatic collection of cookies, we do not honor “do not track” requests.
Advertising Networks and Personalized Advertising
The Site uses Google AdWords, an online advertising service provided by Google Inc., to collects anonymous information about your visits to and interactions with the Site and other web sites. Google Inc. will use this information to target advertisements for goods and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on the Site or on other web sites. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a “pixel tag,” which is industry-standard technology. To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google or to customize your ad preferences, visit Google’s Ad Settings page at http://www.google.com/settings/ads. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site.

Opting out of online ads with one ad network and web browser does not necessarily carry over to any other ad network or web browser. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads from time to time.

We may combine this information with personally identifiable information, other Collected Information, and information obtained from third parties for security reasons. The suppliers that we use to provide the Site may collect information about your visits to the Site and other web sites.

If you are at a WOB location with Bluetooth or WiFi activated, the WOB location may be able to see your device.
WOB may use various technologies to access your location, including GPS and IP addresses. In addition, WOB uses the Google Places API(s) for location searches and as a result is using the Google Maps/Google Earth API(s). Pursuant to the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of Service, use of this location feature is also subject to Google’s privacy policy, which can be found at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy. Both the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by this reference.
Social Media
The Site may allow you to connect and share information with various social media platforms, for example, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest. These features may require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, and application protocol interfaces (APIs) provided by those social media platforms. We may share information that you provide us or that we may collect about your use of the Site with those platforms and that information will be subject to their privacy policies. For further information, we encourage you to review those platforms’ privacy policies: Facebook’s Data Policy at https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy; Instagram’s Privacy Policy at https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy; Twitter’s Privacy Policy at https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en; and Pinterest’s Privacy Policy at https://about.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy.

In certain areas, the information passed between your browser and our system is encrypted with SSL technology to create a protected connection between you and our website to ensure confidentiality.
