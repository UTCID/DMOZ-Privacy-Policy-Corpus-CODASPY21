LIMITATIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY
OVC sells vacation travel provided by third parties (each, a "Travel Supplier") that OVC does not control. OVC is not liable or responsible in any respect for breach of contract, any action or inaction, commission or omission whether intentional, negligent or otherwise, on the part of such third party suppliers resulting in any loss, damage, delay or injury to you or your travel companions. Vacation itineraries, including changes after the sale which may include missed ports of call, are the sole responsibility of the supplier. Furthermore, OVC assumes no responsibility for overbooking, cancellation or delays by hotels, airlines, cruise lines, tour operators or ground transportation or other providers of service. In the event that a travel supplier declares bankruptcy, OVC will not be held responsible. The travel vendor may or may not be required to refund paid fares. OVC cannot be held financially responsible for any vendor that declares bankruptcy. You agree that OVC is not responsible for any potential risks and hazards associated with travel. Assessed government or quasi-government fees and taxes are subject to change without notice at any time, and suppliers reserve the right to add a surcharge for these fees and taxes even if you have a confirmed booking under deposit or have made final payment. All surcharges will be automatically charged to your credit card or in the event of payment by check, you will be asked to immediately remit additional funds.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby irrevocably waive all legal and equitable rights relating to all liabilities, claims, demands, actions, suits, damages, and expenses, including but not limited to claims for copyright or trademark infringement, infringement of moral rights, libel, defamation, invasion of any rights of privacy (including intrusion, false light, public disclosure of private facts, and misappropriation of name or likeness), violation of rights of publicity, physical or emotional injury or distress, or any similar claim or cause of action in tort, contract, or any other legal theory, now known or hereafter known in any jurisdiction throughout the world arising directly or indirectly from OVCâ€™s exercise of their rights pursuant to these Terms or the production, exhibition, exploitation, advertising, promotion, or other use of your photographs and pictures and your image or likeness, and whether resulting in whole or in part by the negligence of OVC or any other person, covenant not to make or bring any such claim against OVC and its affiliates, successors, and assigns, and forever release and discharge OVC and its affiliates, successors, and assigns from liability under such claims.
BOOKING DETAILS
It is the responsibility of the recipient to verify accuracy of all reservation information contained on the confirmation. Names provided to OVC must match legal names as they appear on your passport or government issued photo ID. OVC must be notified immediately if any changes are necessary. Failure to advise OVC in a timely manner may result in substantial penalties.
PRIOR TO TRAVEL
IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO (A) VERIFY PASSPORT REQUIREMENTS, VISA ENTRY AND HEALTH AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTRY TO AND EXIT FROM EACH COUNTRY YOU AND YOUR TRAVEL COMPANIONS WILL ENTER AS PART OF THE PURCHASED TRAVEL PACKAGE, AND (B) TO OBTAIN SUCH UPDATED PASSPORTS, VISAS AND OTHER TRAVEL DOCUMENTS, AND TO MEET SUCH HEALTH AND OTHER COUNTRY TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS AS MAY IN EVERY CASE BE NECESSARY OR REQUIRED TO TRAVEL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PURCHASED TRAVEL PACKAGE (COLLECTIVELY, THE "TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS"). AS AN EXAMPLE AND WITHOUT LIMITATION TO ANY OTHER TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN COUNTRIES REQUIRE U.S. CITIZENS' PASSPORTS TO EXPIRE NO LESS THAN SIX (6) MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF THEIR SCHEDULED RETURN DATE FROM THAT COUNTRY. THIS SIX (6) MONTH EXPIRATION PERIOD MAY BE MORE OR LESS IN OTHER DESTINATIONS. IF YOU OR ANY OF YOUR TRAVEL COMPANIONS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS, YOU AND/OR YOUR TRAVEL COMPANIONS WILL BE PREVENTED FROM, IN ADDITION TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS OR PENALTIES THAT MAY APPLY, (A) BOARDING ANY PLANE, SHIP OR OTHER MODE OF TRANSPORTATION, AND/OR (B) OTHERWISE TRAVELING TO YOUR DEPARTURE DESTINATION. IF SUCH WERE TO OCCUR, YOU BEAR SOLE AND FULL LIABILITY FOR SUCH FAILURE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FORFEITING ANYTHING YOU PAID TO PURCHASE THE APPLICABLE TRAVEL PACKAGE. ANY TRAVEL INSURANCE YOU MAY HAVE PURCHASED IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR TRAVEL PACKAGE DOES NOT COVER ANY LOSS DUE TO YOUR OR YOUR TRAVEL COMPANIONS' FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS.
TO DETERMINE THE TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS, U.S. CITIZENS MAY VISIT, AMONGST OTHER SOURCES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE WEBSITE OR CONTACT THE UNITED STATES' DEPARTMENT OF STATE DIRECTLY VIA PHONE. NON-U.S. CITIZENS MUST CHECK WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL EMBASSY REGARDING PASSPORT, VISA AND IMMUNIZATION AND OTHER TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS.
