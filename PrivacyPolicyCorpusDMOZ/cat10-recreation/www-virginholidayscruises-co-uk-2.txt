As we outline above, in certain circumstances, we are required to share information about you with immigration or other government authorities before we can deliver you to your destination.
12.    HOW WE LOOK AFTER YOUR INFORMATION
12.1    Our security measures
We strive to constantly keep our security practices under review to make sure that we’re keeping your information as safe as possible. We use a variety of different technical and operational security measures to protect your information against unauthorised access or unlawful use. For example we:
Ensure the physical security of our offices, warehouses and other sites;
Ensure the physical and digital security of our equipment, devices and systems by mandating appropriate password protection, encryption and access restrictions;
Are a “PCI DSS” compliant company, meaning that we apply certain high standards of security in respect of your payment information;
Ensure appropriate access controls so that access to your information is only granted to those of our people that need to use it in the course of their work;
Carry out regular penetration testing of our systems and third party reviews of our software; and
Maintain internal policies and deliver data protection and confidentiality training to make sure our people also understand their responsibilities in looking after your information and commit to taking appropriate measures to enforce these responsibilities.
12.2    How you can help ensure the security of your information
You can also play a part in helping to keep your information safe. Here are a few useful starting points:
Choose strong passwords and change them regularly;
Keep your booking references and passwords confidential, and avoid sharing them with anyone else or using your password for multiple accounts;
Log out of “Manage my booking” after each session if you are using a shared computer;
Inform us immediately if you know or suspect that your password or booking reference has been compromised or if someone may have accessed your account;
Keep your devices protected by ensuring that you’re using the latest version of your operating system and have suitable anti-virus software, if applicable; and
Be alert to any fraudulent emails that may appear to be from us, but aren’t. Any emails that we send will come from [*]@virginholidays.com.
12.3    Links to other sites and resources
Our site contains content and links to other sites that are operated by third parties (including the Virgin Travel Group and / or any other third parties whom we believe you may be interested in). Please note that we do not control these third party sites or the cookies that such third parties operate and this Privacy Policy will not apply to them. Be sure to consult the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of the relevant third party site to understand how that site collects and uses your information and to establish whether and for what purposes they use cookies.
13.    HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR
We keep your information for as long as is reasonably necessary to enable us to provide you with the services that you have requested from us, to comply with any legal obligations that require us to keep information, or for as long as we reasonably require for our legitimate interests, including for example for the purposes of exercising our legal rights or defending ourselves against claims. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold and the length of time that we need to keep it. For example:
We try to adopt a paperless approach wherever possible and securely destroy any paper correspondence we receive on a regular basis unless we are required to retain it for evidential or legal purposes;
We retain a suppression list of individuals who no longer wish to be contacted by us indefinitely. We need to keep this information to comply with their wishes not to contact them;
We retain any unsuccessful CV’s or job applications that we receive for a period of up to 2 years in case we think you might be suited to another opportunity that becomes available in the near future;
