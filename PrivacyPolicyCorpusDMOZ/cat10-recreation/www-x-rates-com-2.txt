WHAT ARE COOKIES?
Cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags/beacons and scripts (‘cookies’) are small data files which are downloaded onto your device by the website or mobile application which you are visiting. The next time you visit the same website, cookies ensure that your device is recognised. By using cookies, this website can save information about visits and visitors.
As described in “XE’S USE OF COOKIES” below, we place some of the cookies on the Website or App ourselves, while other cookies are placed by third parties (such as our advertising services supplier, Exponential Interactive, Inc (“Exponential”) – see “Targeting Cookies”). Third-party cookies may collect data outside our Website and App as as well. Cookies cannot view or retrieve data from other cookies, nor can they capture files or data stored on your computer.
Cookies can be utilised to make visiting a website more personal, by, for instance:
displaying relevant navigation settings;
remembering visitors’ preferences;
improving the overall user experience;
limiting the number of advertisements shown.
Generally, cookies can be disabled and the “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you would like to use or access a website, you may do so without accepting all cookies. However, as described in “XE’S USE OF COOKIES” below, you should understand that if you choose not to accept cookies, some services that may be offered through a website may not function properly or optimally, you will not be permitted to access certain secured areas or there may be other effects on your browsing experience.
