Any use of the Sites in violation of the foregoing violates these Terms and may result in, among other things, termination, or suspension of your rights to use the Sites. Except as otherwise provided, you retain ownership of all User Content you post on the Sites. However, if you post User Content to the Sites, unless we indicate otherwise, you grant Biden for President and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, assignable, transferable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any manner or media now known or later developed, including without limitation in advertising, fundraising and other communications in support of Biden for President or the candidates, issues, organizations or causes supported by Biden for President, without any right of compensation or attribution. You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in User Content.
