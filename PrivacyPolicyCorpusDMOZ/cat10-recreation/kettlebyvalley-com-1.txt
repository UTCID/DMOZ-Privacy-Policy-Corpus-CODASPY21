Our Commitment to Privacy
Kettleby Valley Camp (“Kettleby”, “we”, “us” and “our”) is committed to protecting your Personal Information (as defined below) by ensuring that your Personal Information is treated with care and is not used or disclosed in ways to which you have not consented. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the ways in which we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information. It applies to any Personal Information that is collected by us, whether it is collected over the telephone, in writing, or electronically via any website, mobile app or other digital platform on which this Privacy Policy appears (the “Platform”).
Kettleby Valley Camp will never disclose, sell or lease to any third party any Personal Information that you provide to us without your permission, other than as described in this Privacy Policy, or unless we are required to do so by law.
By providing us with your Personal Information and using our Platform, you accept this Privacy Policy and consent to its terms, as well as any other terms that are described to you when your Personal Information is collected. If you do not consent, please do not use the Platform or otherwise provide your Personal Information to us.
It is Kettleby Valley Camp policy to comply with the privacy legislation within each jurisdiction in which we operate. Sometimes the privacy legislation and/or an individual’s right to privacy are different from one jurisdiction to another. This Privacy Policy covers only those activities that are subject to the provisions of Canada’s federal and provincial privacy laws, as applicable.
We may modify, revise or update this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting. Each time you use the Platform, the version of the Privacy Policy then posted will apply to that use, so you should check this page each time you use the Platform.

We will notify the individual from whom the information is collected of the purposes for which we are collecting the information. This notice will be provided at or before the time that we collect the Personal Information. Depending on the way in which Personal Information is collected, this may be done orally or in writing.
Disclosure of Personal InformationWhen Personal Information that has been collected is to be used for a purpose that we have not previously identified, we will communicate the new purpose prior to using the information for the new purpose, unless the new purpose is required or permitted by law. We do not sell our customer lists or other Personal Information.We sometimes retain an affiliated company or an independent third party service or technology provider (“Authorized Service Providers”) to perform on our behalf, certain functions in support of the Platform or the products and services we provide. Such functions could include Platform developers, administrators or hosts. Accordingly, in certain instances these Authorized Service Providers will be provided with Personal Information to the extent that it is necessary in the performance of those specific or related services. We obligate all Authorized Service Providers to use and take steps to protect Personal Information in accordance with the requirements of this Privacy Policy.We may transfer your Personal Information as an asset in connection with any contemplated or actual sale, merger or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets, or as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control, including for the purposes of determining whether to proceed with such transaction or fulfilling any records or other reporting requirements to such parties. In such circumstances, we will ensure that any transfer of Personal Information is subject to applicable law and reasonable data protection security protocols.

Security, Retention and Disposal of Personal InformationWe implement security safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, regardless of the format in which the information is held.
