any content, advertising, products, services, or other materials available from such websites or mobile
applications, nor does CMAB endorse any such websites, mobile applications or resources, or the products
or services assessable on such websites or mobile applications.
12. ARBITRATION / DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Governing Law. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State
of California without application of conflict of laws rules, except that these Arbitration provisions
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
Resolution of Any Dispute. In the event a dispute arises between you and CMAB (“Dispute”), we
want to
provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute. Most customer
concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting us by writing to
California Milk Advisory Board, 2316 Orchard Parkway, Suite 200, Tracy, CA 95377. If, however, the
Dispute cannot be resolved by the personnel directly involved, the parties shall first attempt in good
faith to resolve the Dispute promptly by negotiation between duly appointed executive officers or other
representatives of such parties, with full authority to negotiate and settle the Dispute. If a Dispute
has not been resolved by negotiations within 90 days as provided hereinabove, such Dispute shall be
submitted to JAMS, or its successor (collectively, “JAMS”), for mediation as provided hereinbelow. Any
party involved in the Dispute may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and each other party involved
in the Dispute a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the Dispute and the relief
requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS’
panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties covenant that they will
participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers,
promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of
the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any JAMS employees,
are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation
or other proceeding involving the parties; provided, however, that evidence that is otherwise admissible
or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the
mediation. None of the parties may commence arbitration or a civil action with respect to the matters
submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 30 business days
after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may
continue after the commencement of arbitration or a civil action, if the parties so desire.
Limitation of Legal Remedies. IF THERE IS A DISPUTE THAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED AFTER MEDIATION,
INSTEAD OF
SUING IN COURT, YOU AND CMAB EACH AGREE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES
THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE JAMS ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES, ON AN INDIVIDUAL
BASIS, WITHOUT CLASS RELIEF, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES PERTAINING TO CMAB’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND
STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT PURSUANT TO LAW ARE NOT ARBITRABLE. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be
broadly interpreted. It includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or
any other legal theory (“Claim(s)”). The arbitrator's decision and award are final and binding, with
some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be
entered in any court with jurisdiction.
Jury Trial Waiver. YOU AND CMAB EACH VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESOLVING
ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SITES OR SERVICES.
Class Action Waiver. YOU AND CMAB EACH AGREE THAT CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN
AN
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. All arbitrations under these
Terms must be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator will have no
authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit
you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others, participating in a class,
representative, or collective action as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, acting
as a private attorney general, or joining or consolidating Claims with claims or proceedings brought by
any other person ("Class Action Waiver").
Arbitration Procedures. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a
written
Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief
sought ("Notice"). All Notices to CMAB must be sent to the following address: California Milk Advisory
Board, 2316 Orchard Parkway, Suite 200, Tracy, CA 95377. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on
the most recent contact information that you provide us but if no such information exists or if such
information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section. Upon receipt of such Notice,
the receiving party will have a 60-day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully
curing the Claim, providing all the relief requested in the Notice, or entering into a settlement to
resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. After the expiration of such 60-day cure
period, you or CMAB may commence an arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed to by you and CMAB
in writing, the arbitration will be governed and conducted by JAMS before a single arbitrator with
substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow substantive law in adjudicating the
Dispute. This Section shall be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and CMAB agree that this Section satisfies the writing requirement of the
FAA. The arbitration of any claim will be conducted in the State of Minnesota, and for any non-frivolous
claim that does not exceed $5,000.00, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted
in person or by telephone. Each party will pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and
witnesses. The JAMS rules are available on its website at www.jamsadr.com. To the extent that this
dispute resolution Section conflicts with JAMS minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS rules
and/or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard shall control. Neither party shall
sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the
arbitrator’s award; and any such suit may be brought only in Federal District Court or, if any such
court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction. The arbitrator, and not any federal,
state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the
interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, or enforceability of these Terms
including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable. However, the preceding
sentence shall not apply to the clause entitled “Class Action Waiver”.
Exception to Arbitration. Only disputes or actions pertaining to CMAB’s intellectual property
rights, or statutory claims that pursuant to law are not arbitrable, are exempt from arbitration.
Survival. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
Severability. If any provision of this Section is declared or found by a court of competent
jurisdiction
or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all
other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim
cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.
13. NO RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES
You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there are not third-party
beneficiaries to these Terms.
14. MISCELLANEOUS
These Terms, and policies incorporated herein, are the entire agreement between you and CMAB. They
supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and CMAB relating to your use of
the Site or Services. If these Terms expire or are terminated for any reason, the provisions which by
their nature should continue after termination including Proprietary Rights, Disclaimer of Warranties,
Limitation of Liability, Arbitration/Dispute Resolution, No Rights of Third Parties, and Miscellaneous
shall survive any such expiration or termination. If any provision of these Terms is declared or found
by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision
will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the
remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the
Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.
You may not assign your rights under your CMAB Account or this agreement to any third party without
CMAB’s prior written permission. CMAB may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time. Headings
in the Terms are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or
construction of this agreement. The failure of CMAB to partially or fully exercise any rights or the
waiver of CMAB to enforce any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of
such right by CMAB or be deemed a waiver by CMAB of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any
other term of these Terms. The rights and remedies of CMAB under these Terms and any other applicable
agreement between you and CMAB shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall
not limit CMAB’s right to exercise any other right or remedy. In the event of any conflict or
inconsistency between any of these Terms any other terms or conditions applicable to the Services, we
shall determine which rules, restrictions, limitations, terms and/or conditions shall control and
prevail in our sole discretion, and you specifically waive any right to challenge or dispute such
determination.
