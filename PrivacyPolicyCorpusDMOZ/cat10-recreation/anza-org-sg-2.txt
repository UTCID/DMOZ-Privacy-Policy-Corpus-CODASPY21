Responsible Service of Alcohol Policy
Responsible Service of Alcohol Policy
“ANZA is committed to the responsible service of alcohol to provide events which can be safely enjoyed by all our members and their guests, in a manner that is respectful of each other, the surrounding community and the laws of Singapore. We encourage our guests to drink responsibly and have a great time at all our events.”
Please download our Responsible Service of Alcohol Policy here.
ABOUT USANZA was founded in 1948 to provide friendship and support amongst the Australian and New Zealand families based in Singapore. ANZA has since grown to a membership base of more than 7000, representing a range of nationalities. We still focus on building community, with everything from charity work to children's sports, and a wide range of social events.
