Delta College Online Privacy Statement
This online privacy statement is intended to inform you of the ways in which this
website (“Site”) collects information, the uses to which that information will be
put, and the ways in which we protect information you choose to provide us.
Use of this Site is subject to all applicable state and federal laws, as well as general
Delta College policies.
Information Collected
This Site collects two general types of information: (a) information you voluntarily
provide to us, which may include personal information (such as your name, address,
email address, etc.), and (b) information we collect automatically when you visit
this Site through cookies, third-party tracking technologies and server logs.
Information Voluntarily Provided by You
This Site will only collect personal information that you knowingly and voluntarily
provide, for example, by responding to surveys, completing membership forms, sending
emails, etc. It is this Site’s general practice to use personal information only for
the purposes for which it was requested and any additional uses specifically stated
on the Site. However, information collected through this Site may be subject to Delta
College’s obligation to respond to subpoenas, court orders, discovery requests, and
requests for public records under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Further,
the disclosure of information collected through this Site is subject to the provisions
of the Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act.
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or provide,
and you do so at your own risk. Although this Site has security measures in place
to protect personal information provided to us by users, users should also take steps
to protect personal information. One way to do this is to close all web browsers after
using the Site. Information disclosed in chat rooms, news groups, forums, message
boards and similar contexts may become public. Users should therefore exercise caution
before disclosing personal information in such contexts.
