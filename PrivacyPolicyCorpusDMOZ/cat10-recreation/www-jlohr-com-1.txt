Arbitration And Class Action Waiver
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
You and J. Lohr agree that these Terms of Service affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including, but not limited to: (i) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before these Terms of Service or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and (iii) claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Service. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.
By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with J. Lohr as follows:
Initial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach J. Lohr’s support department at ATTN: Controller, J. Lohr Vineyards & Wines, 1000 Lenzen Avenue, San Jose, CA 95126. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the J. Lohr support department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
BINDING ARBITRATION: If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the date that Informal Dispute Resolution procedures are initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including the Privacy Policy’s formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed US$250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding US$250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com ); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS; and (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to J. Lohr at ATTN: Controller, J. Lohr Vineyards & Wines, 1000 Lenzen Avenue, San Jose, CA 95126
To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, J. Lohr will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, J. Lohr will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America, and you and J. Lohr agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Santa Clara County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER: The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND J. LOHR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
Exception for Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations, or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
30-DAY RIGHT TO OPT OUT: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you use on J. Lohr) written notice of your decision to opt out to J. Lohr ---Attn: Legal; info@jlohr.com
with the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, J. Lohr will not be bound by them.
Changes to This Section: J. Lohr will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any changes to this Section by posting on the Platform, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Platform or sent to you.
Changes to this Section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to This Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the Section entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” Section in existence after you began using the Services.
Survival: This “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” Section shall survive any termination of your account or cessation of use of the Platform, Service, or the Products.
Governing Law and General
The Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal arbitration laws and the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Service and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and J. Lohr.
These Terms of Service, and the other policies posted on our Site, constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Site. J. Lohr’s failure to exercise any right under these Terms of Service does not operate as a waiver of such right. All section titles are for convenience and do not affect the meaning of any provision. All uses of “including” or “includes” may not be interpreted as limiting. If any provision is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable and will not affect any remaining provision.
California Residents
If you are a California resident, you may have these Terms of Service and any additional terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter with your request to ATTN: Controller, J. Lohr Vineyards & Wines, 1000 Lenzen Avenue, San Jose, CA 95126. In addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the Site or to receive further information regarding use of the Site.
