Yes/NoSigned (new owner):Signed on behalf of Greyhounds 4U:Dated: Relinquishment FormRELINQUISHMENT FORM FOR ENTRUSTING A GREYHOUND INTO THE CARE OF GREYHOUNDS 4U Greyhounds 4U take in unwanted greyhounds and finds adoption families for them.  We do not destroy any healthy dog and undertake to give the maximum care to every dog committed to us for rehoming. Due to the large numbers of dogs we have in our care and the time it takes to advertise, find and assure ourselves of good, reliable homes, dogs may remain in kennels for some time until the right home is found. During this waiting period, in the interests of the dog, the dog’s health and character will be assessed. Any retraining and behavioural work will become the responsibility of Greyhounds 4U who reserve the right henceforth to make decisions about the welfare of the dog and its future. We will not disclose where the dog is finally adopted. This is to honour the privacy of the new owner and to give the dog a chance to settle without distraction. When making enquiries, please be aware that we are volunteers carrying out this work in our spare time. We would be grateful therefore if telephone calls would be kept to a minimum.  Greyhounds 4U are very busy with other ongoing rescue and rehoming work. The dog will be safe in our hands and his/her future welfare is of prime importance to us.  Please trust us to carry out this work. DETAILS OF DOG TO BE RELINQUISHED (Any information is useful to us) PET NAME: ……………………………………………………………………………………………………….. RACING NAME: …………………………………………………………………………………………………. BREED: ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………. COLOUR: ………………………………………………………………………………………………………….. SEX: ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… EAR MARK: ………………………………………………………………………………………………………. AGE: ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… MICROCHIP NUMBER: ………………………………………………………………………………………..  DATE OF STERILISATION/NEUTERING: ………………………………………………………………. DATE OF LAST SEASON: …………………………………………………………………………………… LAST VACCINATION DATE: ………………………………………………………………………………… DATE OF KENNEL COUGH VACCINE: …………………………………………………………………… DATE OF LAST WORMING TREATMENT: ……………………………………………………………… ANY KNOWN MEDICAL/HEALTH PROBLEMS: ……………………………………………………….. VETS DETAILS (if known)................................................................................... WHAT DIET HAS HE/SHE BEEN FED?: …………………………………………………………………. ANY DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS?: …………………………………………………………………. PLEASE DESCRIBE TEMPERAMENT: ……………………………………………………………………. PLEASE DESCRIBE HOW HE/SHE REACTS TO OTHER DOGS, SMALL AND LARGE: ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… TO CATS: …………………………………………………………………………………………………………. TO CHILDREN: …………………………………………………………………………………………………. WHAT EXPERIENCE DOES THE DOG ALREADY HAVE OF DOMESTIC/FAMILY LIFE: ….………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… OF STAIRS: ………………………………………………………………………………………………………. OF CAR TRAVEL: ………………………………………………………………………………………………. IS HE/SHE CLEAN IN THE HOUSE? ……………………………………………………………………… IS HE/SHE NOISY OR DESTRUCTIVE WHEN LEFT ALONE: ……………………………………. DOES HE/SHE PULL ON THE LEAD: …………………………………………………………………….. DOES HE/SHE COME BACK TO YOU OBEDIENTLY WHEN LET OFF THE LEAD: ………… DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE ABOUT THE TYPE OF HOME THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE: ……………………………………………………………………………………………………….. YOUR REASON FOR PARTING WITH THIS DOG: ………………………………………………….. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AGREEMENT, I the undersigned agree that (delete appropriately) 1.       I am the owner or 2.       The agent acting on behalf of the owner and I relinquish all rights of ownership of this dog.  I understand and agree that if the above name dog/bitch was adopted through Greyhounds 4U and the adoption agreement is cancelled by either party within three calendar months of my adopting the dog/bitch, I am under no obligation to contribute financially towards to the do/bitch’s care and rehoming costs. I understand and agree that if this adoption agreement is cancelled by either party later than three calendar months of my adopting the dog/bitch, I will make a financial contribution towards the care and rehoming costs of the dog/bitch until the dog/bitch is adopted by another party when my financial obligation will cease.  (Greyhounds 4U request the sum of £3 per day or a maximum donation of £100).  Greyhounds 4U will treat the dog/bitch as a priority case for rehoming but cannot guarantee the length of time it will take to rehome the dog/bitch with a suitable new owner. I pass this dog into the care of Greyhounds 4U on the full understanding that I cannot reclaim the dog back at any time, now or in the future.
