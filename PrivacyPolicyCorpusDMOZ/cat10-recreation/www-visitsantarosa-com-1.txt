This enables the VSR to gather the information about every visit to our site. Once a user has registered on the VSR Website, the VSR might elect to use Cookies to track a specific user. We use this information to enhance the user experience during future visits to the Website. We might also collect information on the browser type including plug-in versions, for example, Flash or QuickTime. Another example of information we might capture is the URL where a user is entering or exiting the site.Cookie UseA Cookie is a small piece of information that the browser sends to the Web server with each page request. A Cookie can be saved on a user's hard drive as a small text file or it can be restricted to the computer's memory where it is removed once the browser is closed. Only the Cookies that are associated with a specific URL are sent to the Web server, Cookies that are sent from one Web server are never sent to another Web server. The VSR uses Cookies to identify specific machines in order to gather aggregate data on how Web users are utilizing the Website. In some cases, Cookies might be used to identify a specific user. You can set your browser to refuse all or some cookies or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Website may become inaccessible or not function properly.Pixel/Spotlight TagsA "pixel tag" or "spotlight tag" is a small graphic file that is included in the Web page being displayed. By virtue of its existence on specific pages the VSR can gain further information on how users are making use of the Website. Since the browser requesting this small graphic file is no different than the browser requesting any other Web page, it is possible that a Cookie might be transmitted along with the request. This means that all the information that is identified in the "Site Traffic Monitoring" section can also be collected by the use of a "pixel" or "spotlight" tag.Transmission of InformationAny material, information or idea you transmit to or post on the Website by any means will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and may be disseminated or used by the VSR or its affiliates for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products.

You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from this Website any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic, or profane material, or any other material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under the law.Third Party LinksThe Website may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites and those other sites have not agreed to our privacy policy. Visit those sites for information regarding their privacy policy prior to providing personal information.Links to Data on Other SitesThe links we provide on the Website to other sites are there for your reference and convenience. We do not control any of these sites, nor are we responsible for their content. VSR does not imply any endorsement of the material on such sites or any association with their operators by including these links on the Website. If you decide to access any of these sites you do so entirely at your own risk and you should be aware that upon using these links, you will leave the Website.Limitation of Warranty and LiabilityTHE WEBSITE, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT, SOFTWARE, FUNCTIONS, MATERIALS, AND INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE ON OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE WEBSITE, IS PROVIDED "AS IS" TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW.

FURTHER, THE VSR AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE VSR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE WEBSITE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. THE VSR AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE USE OF THE WEBSITE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE CONTENT AND ANY ERRORS CONTAINED THEREIN AND THE SOFTWARE WHICH MAY BE DOWNLOADED THEREFROM; AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LITIGATION, OR THE LIKE), WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE NEGATION OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE VSR AND USER. THIS SITE AND THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, FORMS, AGREEMENTS, AND DOCUMENTS WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.IndemnificationYou hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold the VSR, and all its officers, directors, owners, agents, employees, information providers, affiliates, licensors and licensees (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability and costs incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach by you of the Agreement or the foregoing representations, warranties and covenants, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs.Modification of Terms and ConditionsThe VSR reserves the rights, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove any portion of this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time.
