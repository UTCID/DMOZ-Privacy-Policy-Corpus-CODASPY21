Troutnut.com Privacy Policy
Long story short:
Troutnut.com respects your privacy and won't give out or sell your email address or other information to anyone, and we have a pretty secure database so it's not likely to be stolen.
Like half the other sites on the Intenret, we use some advertisements by Google and Amazon, and they use "cookies" to store some basic information about where you've been so they can serve you more relevant ads.
This is no different here than on Google or Amazon themselves, or on all the other sites that use their ads.
However, Google does require that I have a privacy policy explaining this, so I downloaded a standard one and here it is:
