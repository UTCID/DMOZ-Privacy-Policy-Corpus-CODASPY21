Event Coordinators & Privacy
Once again we would like to thank all those members who have stepped up and organized our many varied events. No matter how much we have going on we still need more members to come forward with new ideas and to act as Coordinators. Any E-Board member will be happy to give you any needed assistance to get you started. The more people we have planning events the better our Club will be.To ensure privacy please note that we never post the phone numbers of our event coordinators. If you are a Club member please consult your BuddyList for the number you need. If you do not have one there will be a copy available at the next General Meeting, or contact Melissa.
