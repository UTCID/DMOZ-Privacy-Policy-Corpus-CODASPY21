What is personal information?
‘Personal information’ means information about an identifiable individual. Examples of personal information that we may collect, use and disclose include your contact information (name, address, phone number or email address), your billing information (credit card number or banking information), and other information that you may provide to us. Personal information does not include publicly available information or your business contact information.
What personal information do we collect? To whom do we disclose personal information?
In most cases, we will collect personal information directly from you when you purchase or interact with us about a product or service that we offer or provide (for example, when you subscribe to a newspaper or when you email us or contact us through our website). Occasionally, we may collect personal information from a third party based on your consent or as otherwise permitted by law.
We identify the purposes for which we may collect, use and disclose your personal information at the time that we collect such information. Such purposes include providing and delivering products or services to you, responding to your inquiries, and internal business purposes such as administering or improving our website. We obtain your consent for such purposes at or before the time that we collect, use or disclose your personal information, except where permitted or required by law.
Postmedia’s divisions and affiliates may share personal information with each other in order to fulfill the purposes that you have consented to. We may also share your personal information with third party service providers as necessary for them to provide services on our behalf. Some service providers may be located outside of Canada where personal information may be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions.
We may disclose personal information to a potential purchaser in connection with the sale of some or all of the business of Postmedia, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.
How do we retain and safeguard your personal information?
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and as permitted or required by law. We have implemented physical, organizational, contractual and technological security measures to protect your personal information from loss or theft, and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
