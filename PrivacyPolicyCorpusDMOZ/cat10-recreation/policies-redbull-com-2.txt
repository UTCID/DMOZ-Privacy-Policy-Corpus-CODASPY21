1 Introduction
1.1 The Cookies Policy ("Policy") applies to this website ("Website") and to any website, branded pages on third party platforms (such as Facebook or YouTube) and applications accessed or used through such websites or third party platforms (“Red Bull GmbH Sites”), which are operated by or on behalf of Red Bull GmbH, its subsidiaries and/or affiliated companies (hereinafter “Red Bull GmbH”, "we". "us", "our"). This Policy sets out how we collect and process information about you on Red Bull GmbH Sites through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, unique identifiers and similar technologies and we use the term "cookies" in this Policy to refer to all of these collectively.
1.2 This Policy also applies to our mobile applications and games ("Apps"). For details on the specific IDs used on our Apps, see section 8 of this Policy.
2 What is a cookie?
2.1 A cookie is a small text file or a piece of information that may be stored on your computer or mobile device that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that distinguishes your computer but does not name you. Almost every website uses cookie technology.
2.2 We collect information automatically through the use of cookies. Cookies may be set by us, or they may be set by third parties (as described below). You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies; however, if you do this, some of our Website may not work properly.
2.3 Cookies serve a number of purposes such as letting you navigate between webpages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our Website before or whether you are a new visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. This functionality makes cookies extremely useful to improve your user experience when you return to a website you have already visited.
3 How long do cookies last for?
3.1 Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies'. These cookies exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are 'persistent cookies'. These cookies survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date. They can be used by websites to recognise your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.
4 What other technologies are used to track my Red Bull GmbH Site visits?
4.1 We may also use other tracking technologies, such as pixel tags and web beacons, to better tailor Red Bull GmbHSites in order to provide a better service. These technologies usually work in conjunction with cookies.
4.2 Web beacons are small graphic images that may be included on our Website. Web beacons allow us optimise our products and services and provide us and third-party partners with analytics information, such as how many visitors our Website receives. We may also use web beacons in our email correspondence to determine whether your open them or take any further action.
4.3 We also work with our advertising partners to place cookies on their websites. We do this to help us develop statistics on how often clicking on a Red Bull GmbHadvertisement on a Red Bull GmbH or advertiser website results in a purchase or other interaction on the advertiser's website.

Social Media Cookies.
On some pages of Red Bull GmbHSites, third parties that provide applications through Red Bull GmbH Sites may set their own cookies in order to track the success of their applications or customize applications for you.

Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us. Some pages of Red Bull GmbH Sites may also contain embedded content, such as video content from YouTube, and these sites may set their own cookies.

8 Unique Identifiers (IDs) used in our Apps
8.1 We collect information automatically through the use of IDs. An ID is a specific string of numbers and letters (a "character string") which is assigned to your device, but does not name you. The ID allows us and our selected third parties to track your behaviour when you use the App.
Almost every App uses ID technology. IDs serve a number of purposes such as remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience.
8.2 IDs may tell us, for example, whether you have used our Apps before or whether you are a new user. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see through the Apps are more relevant to you and your interests. This functionality makes IDs extremely useful to improve your user experience.
What types of IDs do we use?
8.3 We use different categories of IDs (such as Adverting IDs and Analytics IDs) which fulfil important functions within the App. You may disable these IDs via your mobile device settings or by using the links provided in the list below, however, there are two broad categories of IDs. IDs that are essential for the operation of Apps, also known as Strictly Necessary IDs, enable features without which you would not be able to use Apps as intended. Your consent is not required for the use of Strictly Necessary IDs, which is why Strictly Necessary IDs cannot be disabled using the features of or the links on App. However, you have the option to completely disable IDs in your device at any time. The other category of IDs are IDs which, in strictly legal terms, are not essential to use the Apps. Nevertheless, these IDs do still fulfil important functions. You may disable any of these IDs via your mobile device settings or by using the links provided in the list below. However, if you do so this may prevent certain features or services of the Apps from working properly and therefore affect your experience whilst using the Apps. The list below shows the full range of IDs we may use with our Apps, however most of our Apps will not use all of these IDs.
Whether or not an ID is used in each App will be based on developer preferences.
8.4 The specific types of IDs and other technologies that may be served through the Apps are described below:

Social Media Plug-ins.
On some parts of the Apps, third parties that provide
applications through our Apps may insert their own
technology ("plug-ins") in order to track the success of
their applications or customize applications for you. For
example, when you share a game score using a social media
sharing button on an App (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or
Google Plus), the social network that has created the
button will record that you have done this. Because of how
these plug-ins work, we cannot access this technology, nor
can the third parties access the data in the IDs used by
us. Some parts of our Apps may also contain embedded
content, such as video content from YouTube, and these
sites may set their own IDs or plug-ins.
Facebook
If you want to prevent this, you must first log out of your
Facebook account before activating the Facebook plug-in, or
alternatively disable all Facebook settings on your device
when using the App.
https://www.facebook.com/policy.php
Twitter
Log out of your Twitter account before activating the
Twitter plug-ins, or alternatively and then disable all
Twitter settings on your device when using the App.
http://twitter.com/privacy
Google+
Do not log in to the App using your Google+ or Google
account.
http://www.google.com/intl/policies/policies/privacy/
8.5 You can also refuse advertising IDs in the settings of your respective operating system. If you need assistance with this, please email us at privacy@redbull.com. Since your ID and plug-in opt-out preferences can be stored on your device, please also note that if you use a different device, you will need to renew your opt-out choices.
