We have a strong tradition of providing quality goods and excellent customer service. Part of achieving this goal involves working with information that helps us understand our customers and what they are searching for when they visit www.casalarga.com.

Shipping Terms & Conditions
Expand
We would like you to be aware that many states have different laws regarding the shipment of wine. Laws vary from being able to ship any amount - to limited amounts by volume by month. Some states do not require additional taxes or paperwork while other states require both and more.
With our new partnership with VinoShipper, we are able to ship to more states than ever. Though we do not ship to all 50 states yet, more are constantly being added. Currently, wine shipping is available to the following states: AL, AK, AZ, CA, DC, CO, FL, GA, IL, IA, KS, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, NE, NV, NH, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OR, SC, TN, TX, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY
Gift Packs and Baskets
Gift packs including wine in a beautiful maroon gift box are available for shipping. You can find them in the “Gift Packs” section of the website. At this time, baskets are not available for shipping outside of NY. There are a few select baskets available for shipping within NY state; contact the wine shop to see what is available.
Delivery
Delivery is available to locations in the Greater Rochester Area. Please contact the Wine Shop at (585) 223-4210, Option 2, to place your order for delivery.
Standard Ground Shipping
The standard shipping option for all orders is UPS Ground Delivery. All orders are shipped from the east coast (Rochester, NY) and typically take 3-6 business days for east coast delivery addresses and 6-10 days for west coast delivery. Your confirmation email from will list a tracking number provided by UPS and will provide the estimated arrival time once the order has been processed.
Express Shipping
Express Shipping, via UPS 3-Day Air, 2-Day Air, is available for an additional shipping charge. During the check-out process the exact shipping charge for the deliveries will be shown for the permitted states.
Order Tracking

Shipping & Handling Charges
For all orders placed online, all shipping & handling charges are noted during the check-out process.
Multiple Delivery Attempts
All packages containing alcohol require an additional fee for an “Adult Signature” which is included in our shipping prices. An adult over 21 must be present to sign for these packages. If an adult is not present, there will be two additional attempts made to deliver these packages. Additionally, packages CANNOT be left in a secure location – a signature must be obtained. UPS will notify the customer after the second attempt of a possible delivery issue. After all three attempts, the package will be returned to Casa Larga Vineyards, and Casa Larga Vineyards will charge the original customer the UPS return fee. Casa Larga will only reship the returned packages to the original shipping destination with customer approval, and then the returned package fee and the reshipping fee must be charged to the customer. If the original customer chooses not to re-send the return package, CLV must still charge the UPS return fee to said customer.
Shipping Addresses
Casa Larga will not be responsible for packages that are shipped with an incorrect or incomplete address when such address is supplied by the customer. Casa Larga Vineyards will charge the customer's credit card $10.00 if the address supplied was incorrect BUT UPS corrected the error and then delivered the package.
