PRIVACY POLCY
TheCampingSource
Statement of Privacy (Last updated: July 30, 2006 )
TheCampingSource is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal
information on our Web sites. This Privacy Statement applies to the network of
TheCampingSource Web Sites that display the TheCampingSource logo and/or
trademark. By using TheCampingSource, you consent to the data practices
described in this statement. If you have questions about this Privacy Statement
or the protection of your personal information on TheCampingSource Web sites,
please write us at info@thcampingsource.com
If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact
TheCampingSource using the contact information at the bottom of this Statement
Collection of your Personal Information
TheCampingSource explicitly asks when it needs information that personally
identifies you ("Personal Information") pertinent to the specific product or
service you are choosing to use or subscribe to on the TheCampingSource web
sites. This information can include your e-mail address, name, address,
telephone number, and credit card number, as applicable. TheCampingSource also
may ask for non-personal information or demographic information. Currently,
TheCampingSource also collects personal information through the use of offline
telesales operations. The information collected during the use of telesales may
be merged with personal information you have previously shared with this Web
site and is used in accordance with this Privacy Statement. The site also may
offer the ability to enter sweepstakes where personal information is collected
in order to notify you if you are the winner of the sweepstakes.
Use of your Personal Information.
TheCampingSource and our affiliates and service partners use your
personal information to operate TheCampingSource sites and to provide the
TheCampingSource services you have requested. TheCampingSource may disclose
your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith
belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law
or comply with legal process served on , TheCampingSource or the site; (b)
protect and defend the rights or property of ; TheCampingSource, the site or
the users of TheCampingSource; or, (c) act under exigent circumstances to
protect the personal safety of users of , TheCampingSource, the site or the
public. Personally identifiable information collected by TheCampingSource may
be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which or
its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this
site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
Sharing your Personal Information with Other Companies
Except as otherwise described in this statement, TheCampingSource will
share your personal information with other companies only with your consent.
For example, when subscribing to a service which involves a third party to
facilitate the service your personal information will be shared. Revenue
Avenue, for example, provides your contact information to affiliate program
owners only with your consent so they can respond to specific customer requests
to join their affiliate networks. Without this relationship, Revenue Avenue
could not provide its service to you. These uses of personal information are
primary to the operation of the site.
Control of your Personal Information
As part of your participation in any of TheCampingSource services,
TheCampingSource allows you to elect to receive certain information and e-mail
from TheCampingSource and its service partners. There are two types of
information sent to TheCampingSource, customers: 1) account specific
information; and, 2) promotional and customer feedback information.
Account specific communications include information that is essential for the
TheCampingSource service to operate properly. This includes the initial welcome
mail describing features and guides to a particular service. It also includes
any communications describing any changes or updates to a particular service or
billing schedule. Because account specific communications are essential to
providing the customer with the most current information on TheCampingSource
services these types of communications will be sent to all TheCampingSource
customers when appropriate. These types of communications are considered an
essential part of the service for which you have signed-up for and you will not
be able to unsubscribe from such mailings.
Promotional and customer feedback information includes special promotional
offers, sweepstakes, contests, and/or customer surveys. For this type of
information, the customer has the ability to opt-in or opt-out from receiving
this type of information. The customer also has the ability to change their
opt-in/out preferences at any time, either by changing their personal
information, described in the next section, or by following the unsubscribe
instructions provided in each mailing.
Please be aware that this Privacy Statement and the choices you make on this
site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided
to TheCampingSource in the context of other, separately operated, products or
services.

to receive further assistance. Security of your Personal Information
TheCampingSource secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
use or disclosure. TheCampingSource secures the personally identifiable
information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure
environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When
sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number and other
financial information) is transmitted over the Internet, it is protected
through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Use of Cookies
To make it easy and convenient for you to login to our services, the
TheCampingSource site does require you to enable cookies to utilize our
services. Because we use cookies, you can bookmark your TheCampingSource start
page and access your account without logging in.
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in
the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to
save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have
returned to a specific page. This simplifies the process of recording your
personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
When you return to the same TheCampingSource Web site, the information you
previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that
you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will
not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the
TheCampingSource Web site and on other Web sites or other web sites you visit.
Use of Privacy Statements by TheCampingSource Partners and Affiliates
While TheCampingSource supports other web site operators using
TheCampingSource services complying with these principles, you should carefully
examine the privacy statements of sites linking to or from TheCampingSource.
Personal information that you choose to provide to other web sites will be
subject to the privacy policies of that specific web site.
Use of Third Party Ad Networks
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on the
TheCampingSource Web sites are displayed by Burst Media Network.
Changes to this Statement
TheCampingSource will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect
company and customer feedback. When TheCampingSource posts changes to this
Statement, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the
Privacy Statement. If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement,
