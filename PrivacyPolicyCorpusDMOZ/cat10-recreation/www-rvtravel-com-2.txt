Fact-checking, ethics and corrections policy
Fact Checking
Our staff writers and freelance contributors must be precise with their words, headlines, quotes, and URLs and, above all else, information they present as factual.
Our writers understand that any questionable information they include in their articles will be verified by our editors. To the best of our knowledge we will not use manipulated or transformed audio, video or photos. Writers do their own fact-checking using their own judgment and information based on our Ethics Policy. If we receive a claim regarding fact-checking on our website, we first contact the source of the claim for further elaboration and supporting information. We also contact individuals and organizations who would have additional information or relevant experience on the subject, as well as researching relevant literature. Depending upon the nature and complexity of the topic, other members of the editorial staff may contribute additional research and changes to the writers’ work. Any piece that does not meet our standards by one or more editors is subject to further revision and review before being released for publication. If we cannot verify information we believe is critical to a clear presentation of the subject matter, we will not publish the article or at the least not use any questionable statements or information presented therein.
Ethics Policy
RVtravel.com believes in honest presentation of its articles, photos, videos, and audio. Its mission is to provide readers with impartial, informative reporting about matters of concern to recreational vehicle enthusiasts.  RVtravel.com treats its readers as fairly and openly as possible. Its policy is to correct errors, large and small, as quickly as possible.
RVtravel.com is financially supported by advertising, voluntary donations by readers and affiliate program commissions. It states plainly on its website that at certain times information may be presented that links to an outside location where an affiliate commission may be earned if something is purchased.
RVtravel.com’s reporting on all platforms will be truthful, transparent and respectful; facts will be accurate, complete and fairly presented. Analysis will represent the editor and publisher’s best independent judgment, not the preferences of other sources. RVtravel.com has no hidden agendas.
When RVtravel.com makes a mistake, as it sometimes does, editors will immediately address the error, correcting it within the article and provide a follow-up article or mention in a newsletter if necessary to set the record straight.
RVtravel.com will not knowingly republish stories, images or other content from outside sources without permission and credit.
The editors will try their best to identify all of their sources, granting individuals anonymity only when the information is critical to the article and there is no other reasonable way to obtain it. Anonymous sources should know that the reporter may share their identity with their editor, who will keep that information confidential.
RVtravel.com writers will never misrepresent themselves or mislead a source to get an interview or a story, and they will always identify themselves as journalists. Multiple efforts will be made to contact the primary subjects and sources of criticism in articles. Contracts with freelance contributors require them to avoid conflicts of interest, real or apparent.
Writers who contribute to RVtravel.com do so with the understanding that the website will never put money above honest journalism. RVtravel.com does not publish articles based on the purchase of advertising. If payment is received to post an article, it will be clearly and prominently identified as Sponsored Content, and be clearly distinguishable from editorial material.
Any sponsor or advertiser messages that contain false or unlawful content, or that RVtravel.com believes undermines the website’s integrity, mission or brand, will not be accepted or in some cases removed at RVtravel.com’s discretion if already posted.
This website utilizes some advertising services. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases. Regardless of this potential revenue, unless stated otherwise, we only recommend products or services we believe provide value to our readers.
