Terms & Conditions
Hello there.
Since not too many people actually read these things, we applaud your inquisitiveness with a non-sarcastic golf clap. The gist of this page is all about being of sound legal age (yup, over 21 in human years) and not mis-using the stuff you find on our little corner of the interwebosphere.
The following mumbo jumbo is the detailed legal-speak version. We recommend reading it in the voice of an olde-timey boxing announcer or even a monster-truck rally guy. This'll ensure consciousness throughout. Cheers!
