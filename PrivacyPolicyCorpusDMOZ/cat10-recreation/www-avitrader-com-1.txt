Lufthansa Group now offers contactless, mobile baggage tracking ©SITA
Lufthansa Group has launched a completely contactless way for passengers to report delayed baggage from their mobile device, avoiding long queues at busy baggage service counters or offices. SITA’s initial trials of WorldTracer® Self Service showed that the service has already proved to be popular with travelers, with two-thirds opting to use this service instead of visiting a baggage counter.
In addition to meeting new COVID-19 hygiene requirements, WorldTracer Self Service saves airlines on average US$10 for every mishandled bag reported by eliminating the need for additional infrastructure to manage the reporting of delayed bags. The latest figures from the 2020 SITA Baggage Report shows that while the number of mishandled bags across the industry has tumbled 45.8% from 46.9 million in 2007 to 25.4 million in 2019, though the cost to the industry was US$2.5 billion last year.
Following the successful launch at Munich airport, the Lufthansa service has now been deployed at Frankfurt a.M. Airport and will be rolled out worldwide over the next few months. The service will also soon be available to all SWISS and Austrian Airlines passengers.
