OCEAN FIRST SWIM POLICIES
At the Ocean First Swim School, we strongly believe in the power of a consistent learning environment which is why we encourage attending your weekly scheduled swim class as often as possible. We also understand that life can get in the way, which is why we offer the following make-up policy.
Make-Up Policy
Absences
All absences now require a 48-hour notice prior to your class.
Absences will not be granted if you do not give us the required notice of your absence.
After one no call/no show to your class we will reach out to check that you still want the spot.
After two no call/no shows to your class you will be dropped from this class.
Make-ups
If you miss a scheduled make-up, it cannot be rescheduled.
Makeups are based on availability and are not guaranteed.
We cannot guarantee the same teacher for your makeup class.
If you wish to make changes to a scheduled make-up class, it must be done at least 48 hours before the make-up class.
Makeups expire 30 days following the absence. We cannot extend past this date.
You cannot schedule your makeup class further than seven days in advance.
Make-ups are no longer valid if your family is not currently enrolled in lessons.
COVID-19 Policy
Absences
Any swimmers or family members that believe they were exposed to COVID-19 or begin showing symptoms of COVID-19 must contact Ocean First immediately. We will then reach out to the other families from your class.
Make-ups
If your swimmer is absent because they, or someone in your family, or someone they were exposed to have symptoms of  COVID-19 your make-up will be granted after your swimmer tests negative for COVID-19.
Drops
If your swimmer or someone in your family tests positive for COVID-19, you will be refunded for the remainder of the tuition month, dropped from your current class, and we will do our best to get you back into a class once your swimmer has tested negative for COVID-19. You must communicate with us prior to missing class so we can inform the other families from your class.
COVID-19 steps to take
If your swimmer or someone in their family has symptoms, the swimmer must test negative for COVID-19 to return to class.
If your swimmer or someone in their family is exposed to someone with COVID-19, you must either test negative or stay home for 14 days before returning to class. You will be given the option of make-ups or credits for the days missed as long as we have been informed prior to your absences.
If your swimmer tests positive for COVID-19, you must notify Ocean First and will be dropped from your class.
We will do our best to get you in a class after you test negative for COVID-19. We understand this is not easy so please do your best to communicate with us about anything regarding swim lessons. We are trying our best to get our swimmers back in the water but safety is our priority.
Diaper Policy
We request that you please take your child to the restroom prior to the start of their class. For the health and safety of our students and our pool, the Ocean First Swim School requires all swimmers under the age of three AND children over the age of three who are not fully potty trained to wear a reusable swim diaper (also known as swim pants). These can be purchased at Ocean First if you do not already own one. Your child will not be allowed to enter the pool if this policy is not followed.
In the event that a potty-trained child has an accident, they will be required to adhere to the diaper policy for a length of time to be determined by management.
Tuition Policy
Tuition for all group classes is $25 per class (monthly fees range from $75-$125) and payments are due by the first week of each month.
We offer private & semi-private classes, subject to availability. Email us to inquire.
Please email swim@oceanfirst.blue if you have any questions.
