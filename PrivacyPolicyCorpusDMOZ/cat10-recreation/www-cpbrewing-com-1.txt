where the comment was left.

with cpbrewing.com in ways that require cpbrewing.com to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that cpbrewing.com gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at cpbrewing.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with cpbrewing.com are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
