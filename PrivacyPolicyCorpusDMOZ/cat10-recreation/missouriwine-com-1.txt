Shipping
Rates and charges:
The shipping rate for all products is based on shipping destination, weight and dimension. Oversized or overweight packages might have additional charges.
How orders are processed:
Orders will be shipped and your credit card will be processed within 2 business days of receiving your order. We make every effort to ship orders received on the same business day (excluding holidays/weekends).
Taxes:
State tax will be added to all orders shipped to states with this requirement.
Notification of order:
We will send a confirmation e-mail shipment notification to inform you when your order has shipped, but point-to-point or in-transit information may not be available.
Pickup is an Option:
If you live in or near our location and wish to pickup your order, please specify details on the form at checkout and we will notify you when your order is available for pickup.
Returns
Except in those cases where a shipment was received in damaged condition, all sales are final. Customers may report damaged shipments by contacting us directly.
Security
Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our payment gateway software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read over the internet.
If you have any questions about our policies and procedures, please contact us.
