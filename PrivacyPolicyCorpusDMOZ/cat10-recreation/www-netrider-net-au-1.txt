Please take a few moments to
fill in your profile and introduce yourself. While we love 'newbies' and certainly welcome them you're much more likely to get serious answers with your profile and avatar filled in. Most profile information is optional and editable at any time.
Like any community we have a few rules to keep things humming along. You can read through the full terms and rules and privacy policy but essentially it's 3 common sense rules:
Be respectful to your fellow members
Report any problems
No Spamming (unapproved advertising)
When joining any community you can't come in and immediately do everything. There is a period where we get to know you and you get to know us. During that time some functions of the site will be unavailable to you. Gradually as we become acquainted extra site capabilities will open up to you. New members are subject to a few additional rules to thwart spammers such as restrictions on signatures, status updates, and private conversations. A couple of forums are also hidden from view for privacy concerns. These restrictions are lifted once you are automatically validated. Be patient, contribute to the site and enjoy the process.
