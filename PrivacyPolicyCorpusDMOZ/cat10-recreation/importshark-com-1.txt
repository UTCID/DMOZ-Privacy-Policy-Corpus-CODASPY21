Importshark Privacy Notice
Your Privacy
At Importshark we are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers as well as visitors to our web site. In particular, we want you to know that Importshark is not in the business of selling, renting or trading your information with other companies and businesses for marketing purposes.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address.
In general, you can browse our web site without giving us any personal information. We use several products to analyze traffic to this web site in order to understand our customers and visitors needs and to continually improve our site for them. We collect only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we do not tie a specific visitor to a specific IP address.
Additional activities on our site require you to be registered—for example, purchasing products, inquiring about a product, submitting product reviews. As part of the registration process, we collect additional personal information. We use that information for several general purposes: to fulfill
an
order made; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to contact you regarding an inquiry or product review.
Importshark may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of
Importshark and/or its subsidiaries or to (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on Importshark or this web site; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Importshark and this web site; (3) enforce its agreements with you, or (4) act in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety or the public.
Credit/Debit Card Information
Importshark uses third party credit/debit card processing services (PayPal). For your protection, and to avoid liability, Importshark is not able to view and or access your card information.
Disclosure of Personal Information
In some instances we rely on our outside vendors to fulfill product purchases—for example, drop shipping from a manufacturer, shipping vendors (USPS, FedEx, UPS ….. etc).
To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
