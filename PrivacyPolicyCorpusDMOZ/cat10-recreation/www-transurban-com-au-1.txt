When you request access to personal information, we may need to take measures to verify your identity before providing you with such information.
In some circumstances it may not be possible for us to provide you with all of your personal information, or an exemption under the Privacy Act may apply. For example, we may not be able to give you access if it would unreasonably affect someone else’s privacy. If we do not provide access to the personal information held about you, we will tell you why.
We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we hold about you is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading.
If you think that any personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may contact us. We will take reasonable steps to make sure that the information is corrected.
